Since traditional post-marketing surveillance systems based on spontaneous reports have a serious underreporting issue, in recent years research on the detection of adverse reaction events using social media such as Twitter as a data source has attracted increasing attention in recent year. Deep learning models usually rely on a large number of training samples. However, due to the characteristics of user-generated content and the time-consuming data annotation process, related research is faced with the problems caused by small-scale annotated datasets, which restricts deep learning models in achieving satisfactory results. Accordingly, we introduce two regularization methods are introduced at the representation level, i.e., graph embedding-based data augmentation and adversarial training, to improve the performance of detecting adverse events under such conditions. Besides, the applicable scope of these two methods is analyzed and discussed through experiments. Combined with the convolutional neural network, this paper proposes an adverse drug event detection framework that can make full use of the methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Adversarial training; Adverse drug events; Graph embeddings; Natural language processing","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Drug products; Social networking (online); Adverse drug reactions; Annotated datasets; Data augmentation; Graph embeddings; Reaction events; Regularization methods; Surveillance systems; User-generated content; Learning systems",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 62072288","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [ 62072288 ].",,"Plumpton, C., Roberts, D., Pirmohamed, M., Hughes, D., A systematic review of economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing for prevention of adverse drug reactions (2016) Pharmaco Econ., 34 (8), pp. 771-793; Al Dweik, R., Yaya, S., Stacey, D., Kohen, D., Patients’ experiences on adverse drug reactions reporting: a qualitative study (2020) Eur.

However, existing studies usually only use word embeddings as the input for deep learning models, which ignores the structural information of sentences. In addition, deep learning models usually require a large number of cases for training, but the scale of annotated corpora that can be used for this task is limited. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a graph-boosted framework, that constructs the text into a graph structure. By using pre-trained graph embeddings and word embeddings for model training, our proposed framework provides richer semantic and structural information for prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used in different deep learning models and bring improvements when using the TwiMed corpus of different scales. © 2020 IEEE.","adverse drug events; deep learning; graph embeddings; graph structure; natural language processing","Bioinformatics; Deep learning; Embeddings; Graph structures; Semantics; Social networking (online); Event detection; Graph embeddings; Learning models; Model training; Reporting systems; Side effect; Structural information; Learning systems",,,,,,,,"Ruiz, B., Garcia, M., Aguirre, U., Aguirre, C., Factors predicting hospital readmissions related to adverse drug reactions (2008) European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 64 (7), pp. 715-722; Al Dweik, R., Yaya, S., Stacey, D., Kohen, D., Patients' experiences on adverse drug reactions reporting: A qualitative study (2020) European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology; Hazell, L., Shakir, S., Under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (2006) Drug Safety, 29 (5), pp. 385-396; Kim, Y., Convolutional neural networks for sentence classification (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1746-1751; Du, C., Huang, L., Text classification research with attention-based recurrent neural networks (2018) International Journal of Computers Communications & Control, 13 (1), pp. 50-61; Li, F., Zhang, M., Fu, G., Qian, T., Ji, D., (2016) A Bi-lstm-rnn Model for Relation Classification Using Low-cost Sequence Features; Joulin, A., Grave, E., Bojanowski, P., Mikolov, T., Bag of tricks for efficient text classification (2017) Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 427-431; Kuhn, M., Letunic, I., Jensen, L., Bork, P., The sider database of drugs and side effects (2015) Nucleic Acids Research, 44 (1), pp. D1075-D1079; Nikfarjam, A., Sarker, A., O'Connor, K., Ginn, R., Gonzalez, G., Pharmacovigilance from social media: Mining adverse drug reaction mentions using sequence labeling with word embedding cluster features (2015) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 22 (3), pp. 671-681; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the 19th Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1532-1543; Wang, D., Cui, P., Zhu, W., Structural deep network embedding (2016) Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIgKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1225-1234; Alvaro, N., Miyao, Y., Collier, N., TwiMed: Twitter and pubmed comparable corpus of drugs, diseases, symptoms, and their relations (2017) JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, 3 (2), p. e24",,"Park T.Cho Y.-R.Hu X.T.Yoo I.Woo H.G.Wang J.Facelli J.Nam S.Kang M.","Bio-Synergy Research Center (BSRC);Korea Genome Open HRD (K-GENOME);Korea Genome Organization (KOGO);Korean Federation of Science and Technology Societies (KOFST);Seoul National University;Seoul National University (SNU) Bioinformatics Institute","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","2020 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, BIBM 2020","16 December 2020 through 19 December 2020",,166496,,9781728162157,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The purpose of this study is to identify the different text mining approaches used in different application areas of the biomedical domain, the common tools used and the challenges of biomedical text mining as compared to generic text mining algorithms. This study will be of value to biomedical researchers by allowing them to correlate text mining approaches to specific biomedical application areas. Implications for future research are also discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The review was conducted following the principles of the Kitchenham method. A number of research questions were first formulated, followed by the definition of the search strategy. The papers were then selected based on a list of assessment criteria. Each of the papers were analyzed and information relevant to the research questions were extracted. Findings: It was found that researchers have mostly harnessed data sources such as electronic health records, biomedical literature, social media and health-related forums. The most common text mining technique was natural language processing using tools such as MetaMap and Unstructured Information Management Architecture, alongside the use of medical terminologies such as Unified Medical Language System. The main application area was the detection of adverse drug events. Challenges identified included the need to deal with huge amounts of text, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, the duality of meaning of words in biomedical text and the amount of noise introduced mainly from social media and health-related forums. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, other reviews in this area have focused on either specific techniques, specific application areas or specific data sources. The results of this review will help researchers to correlate most relevant and recent advances in text mining approaches to specific biomedical application areas by providing an up-to-date and holistic view of work done in this research area. The use of emerging text mining techniques has great potential to spur the development of innovative applications, thus considerably impacting on the advancement of biomedical research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Biomedical literature; Biomedical text mining; Kitchenham methodology; Text mining Techniques; Text mining tools",,,,,,,,,"Abulaish, M., Parwez, M.A., DiseaSE: a biomedical text analytics system for disease symptom extraction and characterization (2019) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 100, p. 103324; Agarwal, V., Zhang, L., Zhu, J., Fang, S., Cheng, T., Hong, C., Shah, N.H., Impact of predicting health care utilization via web search behavior: a data-driven analysis (2016) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 18 (9); Alex, B., Grover, C., Tobin, R., Sudlow, C., Mair, G., Whiteley, W., Text mining brain imaging reports (2019) Journal of Biomedical Semantics, 10 (S1), p. 23; Allahyari, M., Pouriyeh, S., Assefi, M., Safaei, S., Trippe, E.D., Gutierrez, J.B., Kochut, K., (2017) A brief survey of text mining: classification, clustering and extraction techniques, , arXiv preprint; Amrit, C., Paauw, T., Aly, R., Lavric, M., (2016) Using text mining and machine learning for detection of child abuse, , arXiv preprint; Anholt, R.M., Berezowski, J., Jamal, I., Ribble, C., Stephen, C., Mining free-text medical records for companion animal enteric syndrome surveillance (2014) Preventive Veterinary Medicine, 113 (4), pp. 417-422; Arnold, P., Rahm, E., (2015) SemRep: a repository for semantic mapping.

Existing dictionary-based, semi-supervised learning approaches are intrinsically limited by the coverage and maintainability of laymen health vocabularies. In this paper, we introduce a data augmentation approach that leverages variational autoencoders to learn high-quality data distributions from a large unlabeled dataset, and subsequently, to automatically generate a large labeled training set from a small set of labeled samples. This allows for efficient social-media ADR detection with low training and re-training costs to adapt to the changes and emergence of informal medical laymen terms.

Social media, such as Twitter, has become a valuable online tool to describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more than one cell population would be adversely affected. These types of side effect are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed drugs but do not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate method to collect and classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter. Materials and Methods: In this classification method, we selected ""ask a patient"" dataset and combination of Twitter ""Ask a Patient"" datasets that comprised of 6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with the word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture by HAN, FastText, and CNN. Results: Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more advanced peculiarity in learning information compared to other types of machine learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of incorporating various semantic features, including topics and concepts. Conclusion: Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the combination of Twitter and ""Ask a Patient"" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learning-based text classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR. © 2020 Royan Institute (ACECR).

However, when prescribing drugs, doctors must be conscious of all potential drug side effects. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adverse drug events (ADEs), or harmful side effects, account for 1/3 of total hospital admissions each year. The goal of this research is to utilize novel deep learning methods for accurate detection and identification of professionally unreported drug side effects using widely available public data (open data). Utilizing a manually-labelled dataset of 10,000 reviews gathered from WebMD and Drugs.com, this research proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based models for ADE detection and extraction and compares results to standard deep learning models and current state-of-the-art extraction models. By utilizing a hybrid of transfer learning from pre-trained BERT representations and sentence embeddings, the proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.94 for ADE detection and an F1 score of 0.97 for ADE extraction. Previous state of the art deep learning approach achieves an AUC of 0.85 in ADE detection and an F1 of 0.82 in ADE extraction on our dataset of review texts. The results show that a BERT-based model achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the ADE detection and extraction task. This approach can be applied to multiple healthcare and information extraction tasks and used to help solve the problem that doctors face when prescribing drugs. Overall, this research introduces a novel dataset utilizing social media health forum data and shows the viability and capability of using deep learning techniques in ADE detection and extraction as well as information extraction as a whole. The model proposed in this paper achieves state-of-the-art results and can be applied to multiple other healthcare and information extraction tasks including medical entity extraction and entity recognition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BERT; Deep learning; Drug side effects; Information extraction; Natural language processing; Open data; Pharmacovigilance","Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data mining; Drug interactions; Health care; Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Open Data; BERT; Department of healths; Detection and identifications; Drug side effects; Hospital admissions; Learning-based approach; NAtural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Adams, D.Z., Gruss, R., Abrahams, A.S., Automated discovery of safety and efficacy concerns for joint \& muscle pain relief treatments from online reviews (2017) International Journal of Medical Informatics, 100, pp. 108-120; Aron, R., Dutta, S., Janakiraman, R., Pathak, P.A., The impact of automation of systems on medical errors: Evidence from field research (2011) Information Systems Research, 22 (3), pp. 429-446; Bengio, Y., LeCun, Y., Scaling learning algorithms towards AI (2007) Large-Scale Kernel Machines, 34 (5), pp. 1-41; Bian, J., Topaloglu, U., Yu, F., Towards large-scale twitter mining for drug-related adverse events (2012) International workshop on smart health and wellbeing, Maui; Brown, M.T., Bussel, J.K., Medication adherence: Who cares?

Being able to identify Twitter posts of personal experience related to medication use is as important as being able to identify expressions of adverse medical events/reactions for the surveillance purpose. Identifying personal experience tweets is a challenging task, especially in the aspect of engineering features for classification. Word embedding has become a superior alternative to engineered features in many text classification applications. To investigate if word embedding-based methods can perform constantly better than conventional classification methods with engineered features, we assessed the classification performance of 4 word embedding techniques: GloVe, word2vec, fastText, and wordRank. Using a corpus of 22 million unlabeled tweets for learning of word embedding and a corpus of 12,331 annotated tweets for classification, we discovered that word embedding-based classification methods consistently outperform the engineered feature-based classification methods with statistical significance of p &lt; 0.01, but there exist no significantly statistical differences among the 4 study word embedding methods (p &lt; 0.05). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Classification; Natural language processing; Personal experience; Pharmacovigilance; Twitter; Word embedding",,,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH: 1R15LM011999–01","Acknowledgements Authors wish to thank anonymous reviewers in critiquing our work and providing constructive comments that improved the manuscript.

A fundamental step toward incorporating Twitter data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatically recognize medication mentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names suffer from low recall due to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced method to recognize them. Materials and Methods: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning classifier able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary supplements. Kusuri (""medication"" in Japanese) is composed of 2 modules: first, 4 different classifiers (lexicon based, spelling variant based, pattern based, and a weakly trained neural network) are applied in parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names; second, an ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantic, and long-range dependencies of important words in the tweets makes the final decision. Results: On a class-balanced (50-50) corpus of 15 005 tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with an F1 score of 93.7%, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of all tweets posted by 112 Twitter users (98 959 tweets, with only 0.26% mentioning medications), Kusuri obtained an F1 score of 78.8%. To the best of our knowledge, Kusuri is the first system to achieve this score on such an extremely imbalanced dataset. Conclusions: The system identifies tweets mentioning drug names with performance high enough to ensure its usefulness, and is ready to be integrated in pharmacovigilance, toxicovigilance, or more generally, public health pipelines that depend on medication name mentions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The adoption of social media data has been hindered by the massive and noisy nature of the data. Initial attempts to use social media data have relied on exact text matches to drugs of interest, and therefore suffer from the gap between formal drug lexicons and the informal nature of social media. The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of >0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% (±0.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% (±0.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% (±0.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% (±0.05%) were pill marks. We find that our system captures an additional 20% of mentions; these would have been missed by approaches that rely solely on exact string matches. We provide a lexicon of misspellings and synonyms for 2978 drugs and a word embedding model trained on a health-oriented subset of Reddit. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Drug Surveillance; Lexicon; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media","Embeddings; Errors; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Automated classification; Lexicon; NAtural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Potential sources; Social media; Social media datum; String match; Social networking (online); Article; automation; classification algorithm; data accuracy; drug classification; drug information; information retrieval; mobile application; natural language processing; performance; pharmacovigilance; priority journal; social media; classification; data mining; drug database; drug surveillance program; human; information dissemination; natural language processing; procedures; drug; Data Mining; Databases, Pharmaceutical; Humans; Information Dissemination; Natural Language Processing; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media",,"Pharmaceutical Preparations",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DGE - 1656518

These tasks are a crucial step to many natural language understanding applications in the biomedical domain. Automatic medical coding of electronic medical records, automated summarizing of patient records, automatic cohort identification for clinical studies, text simplification of health documents for patients, early detection of adverse drug reactions or automatic identification of risk factors are only a few examples of the many possible opportunities that the text analysis can offer in the clinical domain. In this work, our efforts are primarily directed towards the improvement of the pharmacovigilance process by the automatic detection of drug-drug interactions (DDI) from texts. Moreover, we deal with the semantic analysis of texts containing health information for patients. Our two-stage approach is based on Deep Learning architectures. Concretely, NER is performed combining a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and a Conditional Random Field (CRF), while RE applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Since our approach uses very few language resources, only the pre-trained word embeddings, and does not exploit any domain resources (such as dictionaries or ontologies), this can be easily expandable to support other languages and clinical applications that require the exploitation of semantic information (concepts and relationships) from texts. During the last years, the task of DDI extraction has received great attention by the BioNLP community. However, the problem has been traditionally evaluated as two separate subtasks: drug name recognition and extraction of DDIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an evaluation of the whole pipeline. Moreover, our system obtains state-of-the-art results on the eHealth-KD challenge, which was part of the Workshop on Semantic Analysis at SEPLN (TASS-2018). © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Deep learning; Health documents; Name entity recognition; Relation extraction","Automation; Drug interactions; Extraction; Health; Health risks; Image segmentation; Long short-term memory; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Random processes; Risk assessment; Semantics; Text processing; Automatic identification; Conditional random field; Convolutional neural network; Electronic medical record; Name entity recognition; Named entity recognition; Natural language understanding; Relation extraction; Deep learning; Article; clinical medicine; convolutional neural network; electronic medical record; human; machine learning; medical information; medical record; medical research; natural language processing; pharmacovigilance; priority journal; recognition; recurrent neural network; risk factor; semantics; short term memory; social media; classification; coding; data mining; drug interaction; electronic health record; procedures; Clinical Coding; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Drug Interactions; Electronic Health Records; Humans",,,,,"Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO: TIN2017-87548-C2-1-R","This work was supported by the Research Program of the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness - Government of Spain , (DeepEMR project TIN2017-87548-C2-1-R).",,"Dalianis, H., Applications of Clinical Text Mining (2018), Springer International Publishing doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-78503-5-10; Hirschman, L., Yeh, A., Blaschke, C., Valencia, A., Overview of BioCreAtIvE: critical assessment of information extraction for biology (2005) BMC Bioinform., 6 (1). , S1, ISSN 1471–2105; Segura-Bedmar, I., Martınez, P., Sánchez-Cisneros, D., The 1st DDIExtraction-2011 challenge task: extraction of Drug-Drug Interactions from biomedical texts (2011) Proceedings of DDIExtraction-2011 challenge task; Segura, I., Bedmar, P., (2013), pp. 341-350. , Martínez, M.

These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ML methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex NLP and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and NLP to identify AEs and signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) in patient-generated SM. We also examined the performance of lift in SM-based signal detection (SD). Methods: Our examination was performed in a corpus of SM posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported VigiBase data as reference data set. Results: We found that co-occurrence and NLP produce AEs, which are 57% and 93% consistent with VigiBase AEs, respectively. Among the SDRs identified both in SM and in VigiBase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in NLP-processed SM. Using lift in SM SD provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in NLP-processed AEs. Conclusion: Our results indicate that using SM as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further. Various levels of SM processing may be considered, depending on the preferred policies and tolerance for false-positive to false-negative balance in routine pharmacovigilance processes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adverse event (AE); lift; machine learning (ML); natural language processing (NLP); pharmacoepidemiology; signal of disproportionate reporting (SDR); social media (SM)","accuracy; algorithm; Article; comparative study; data base; data processing; human; machine learning; natural language processing; pharmacovigilance; predictive value; priority journal; quality of life; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; social media; Unified Medical Language System; word processing; adverse drug reaction; drug surveillance program; false negative result; false positive result; feasibility study; information processing; natural language processing; procedures; social media; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Data Collection; Datasets as Topic; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; False Negative Reactions; False Positive Reactions; Feasibility Studies; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Social Media",,,,,,"The authors state that no ethical approval was needed.

Social media have been considered as a possible alternative data source for gathering consumer-generated information of their experience with medications. Identifying personal experience in social media data is a challenging task in natural language processing. In this study, we investigated a method of predicating personal experience tweets using Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and neural networks, in which BERT models contextually represented the tweet text. Both pre-trained BERT models and our BERT model trained with 3.2 million unlabeled tweets were examined. Our results show that our trained BERT model performs better than Google's pre-trained models (p < 0.01).

One plausible venue to collect evidence of such ADRs is online social media, where patients and doctors discuss medical conditions and their treatments. There is substantial previous research on ADRs extraction from English online forums. However, very limited research was done on Chinese data. In this paper, we try to use the posts from two popular Chinese social media as the original dataset. We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that detects mentions of medications and colloquial ADR terms and extracts lexicon-syntactic features from natural language text to recognize positive associations between drug use and ADRs. The key contribution is an automatic label generation algorithm, which requires very little manual annotation. This bootstrapping algorithm could also be further applied on English data. The research results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the hidden Markov model and conditional random fields. With this approach, we discovered a large number of side effects for a variety of popular medicines in real world scenarios. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adverse drug reaction; Chinese social media; Natural language processing","Character recognition; Hidden Markov models; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Pharmacodynamics; Supervised learning; Adverse drug reaction (ADRs); Adverse drug reactions; Bootstrapping algorithm; Conditional random field; NAtural language processing; Pharmaceutical company; Semi- supervised learning; Social media; Social networking (online)",,,,,"AstraZeneca

Information technology solutions aiming at extracting adverse reactions (ADRs) from posts on health forums require a rigorous evaluation methodology if their results are to be used to make decisions. First, a gold standard, consisting of manual annotations of the ADR by human experts from the corpus extracted from social media, must be implemented and its quality must be assessed. Second, as for clinical research protocols, the sample size must rely on statistical arguments. Finally, the extraction methods must target the relation between the drug and the disease (which might be either treated or caused by the drug) rather than simple co-occurrences in the posts. Objective: We propose a standardized protocol for the evaluation of a software extracting ADRs from the messages on health forums. The study is conducted as part of the Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media project. Methods: Messages from French health forums were extracted. Entity recognition was based on Racine Pharma lexicon for drugs and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology for potential adverse events (AEs). Natural language processing-based techniques automated the ADR information extraction (relation between the drug and AE entities). The corpus of evaluation was a random sample of the messages containing drugs and/or AE concepts corresponding to recent pharmacovigilance alerts. A total of 2 persons experienced in medical terminology manually annotated the corpus, thus creating the gold standard, according to an annotator guideline. We will evaluate our tool against the gold standard with recall, precision, and f-measure. Interannotator agreement, reflecting gold standard quality, will be evaluated with hierarchical kappa. Granularities in the terminologies will be further explored. Results: Necessary and sufficient sample size was calculated to ensure statistical confidence in the assessed results. As we expected a global recall of 0.5, we needed at least 384 identified ADR concepts to obtain a 95% CI with a total width of 0.10 around 0.5. The automated ADR information extraction in the corpus for evaluation is already finished. The 2 annotators already completed the annotation process. The analysis of the performance of the ADR information extraction module as compared with gold standard is ongoing. Conclusions: This protocol is based on the standardized statistical methods from clinical research to create the corpus, thus ensuring the necessary statistical power of the assessed results. Such evaluation methodology is required to make the ADR information extraction software useful for postmarketing drug safety surveillance. © Armelle Arnoux-Guenegou, Yannick Girardeau, Xiaoyi Chen, Myrtille Deldossi, Rim Aboukhamis, Carole Faviez, Badisse Dahamna, Pierre Karapetiantz, Sylvie Guillemin-Lanne, Agnès Lillo-Le Louët, Nathalie Texier, Anita Burgun, Sandrine Katsahian.","Data mining; Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; MedDRA; Natural language processing; Racine Pharma; Social media",,,,,,"Cap Digital

Detection of such ADRs is limited in clinical trials, which are underpowered to detect rare events. Early recognition of ADRs in the postmarketing phase could substantially reduce morbidity and decrease societal costs. Internet community health forums provide a mechanism for individuals to discuss real-time health concerns and can enable computational detection of ADRs. Objective: The goal of this study is to identify cutaneous ADR signals in social health networks and compare the frequency and timing of these ADRs to clinical reports in the literature. Methods: We present a natural language processing-based, ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts on Internet social health networks. We identified user posts from the Inspire health forums related to two chemotherapy classes: erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, and nivolumab and pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors. We extracted mentions of ADRs from unstructured content of patient posts. We then performed population-level association analyses and time-to-detection analyses. Results: Our system detected cutaneous ADRs from patient reports with high precision (0.90) and at frequencies comparable to those documented in the literature but an average of 7 months ahead of their literature reporting. Known ADRs were associated with higher proportional reporting ratios compared to negative controls, demonstrating the robustness of our analyses. Our named entity recognition system achieved a 0.738 microaveraged F-measure in detecting ADR entities, not limited to cutaneous ADRs, in health forum posts. Additionally, we discovered the novel ADR of hypohidrosis reported by 23 patients in erlotinib-related posts; this ADR was absent from 15 years of literature on this medication and we recently reported the finding in a clinical oncology journal. Conclusions: Several hundred million patients report health concerns in social health networks, yet this information is markedly underutilized for pharmacosurveillance. We demonstrated the ability of a natural language processing-based signal-generation pipeline to accurately detect patient reports of ADRs months in advance of literature reporting and the robustness of statistical analyses to validate system detections. Our findings suggest the important contributions that social health network data can play in contributing to more comprehensive and timely pharmacovigilance. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc.

In this work, we investigate the effect of health-related entities such as adverse drug reactions and drug indications on rating prediction. We present a method based on a supervised regression approach leveraging medical concepts of different types and their mechanisms. The experiments on a collection of reviews demonstrate that features based on biomedical entities mentioned in reviews result in performance gains of up to 8% in mean squared error. Moreover, we compute feature importance in the regression models and find that the most important features for predicting patients’ negative attitudes are adverse drug reactions associated with functional problems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adverse drug reactions; Health social media; Machine learning; Natural Language Processing; Opinion mining; Rating prediction","Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Pharmacodynamics; Regression analysis; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Adverse drug reactions; Biomedical information extractions; Functional problems; Important features; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Patient satisfaction; Social media; Image analysis",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 18-11-00284","Acknowledgments.

AE are health problems that can occur during treatment with a pharmaceutical product, which in the drug’s post-marketing period can require a significant increase in health care and result in unnecessary and often fatal harm to patients. Therefore, a key objective for the health system is to identify AE as soon as possible in the post-marketing period. Some countries have pharmacovigilance systems responsible for collecting voluntary reports of post-marketing AE, but studies have shown that social networks can be used to obtain more and faster reports. The current project’s main objective is to build a totally automated system using Twitter as a source to detect both new and previously known AE and conduct the statistical analysis of the resulting data. A system was thus built to collect, process, analyze, and assess tweets in search of AE, comparing them to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data and the reference standard. The results allowed detecting new and existing AE related to the drug doxycycline, showing that Twitter can be useful in pharmacovigilance when employed jointly with other data sources. © 2019, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

The huge amount of data inspires research and development focused on novel clinical natural language processing (NLP) solutions to optimize clinical care and improve patient outcomes. In recent years, deep learning techniques have demonstrated superior performance over traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for various general-domain NLP tasks, e.g., language modeling, parts-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition, paraphrase identification, sentiment analysis, etc. Clinical documents pose unique challenges compared to general-domain text due to the widespread use of acronyms and nonstandard clinical jargons by healthcare providers, inconsistent document structure and organization, and requirement for rigorous de-identification and anonymization to ensure patient data privacy. This tutorial chapter will present an overview of how deep learning techniques can be applied to solve NLP tasks in general, followed by a literature survey of existing deep learning algorithms applied to clinical NLP problems. Finally, we include a description of various deep learning-driven clinical NLP applications developed at the artificial intelligence (AI) lab in Philips Research in recent years—such as diagnostic inferencing from unstructured clinical narratives, relevant biomedical article retrieval based on clinical case scenarios, clinical paraphrase generation, adverse drug event (ADE) detection from social media, and medical image caption generation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Artificial intelligence; Character recognition; Clinical research; Data privacy; Diagnosis; Health care; Hospital data processing; Learning algorithms; Medical imaging; Modeling languages; Sentiment analysis; Speech recognition; Syntactics; Document structure; Electronic health record systems; Health care providers; Learning techniques; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Paraphrase identifications; Research and development; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Alsaffar, M., Yellowlees, P., Odor, A., Hogarth, M., The state of open source electronic health record projects: A software anthropology study (2017) JMIR Med.

The subjective information implies the opinions, beliefs, feelings and attitudes that people express towards different topics of interest. Moreover, this type of information is of great importance for companies, organizations or individuals, because it allows them to carry out actions that benefit them. Besides, sentiment analysis is the field that studies subjective information through natural language processing, computational linguistics, information retrieval and data mining techniques. Sentiment analysis is very useful in various domains, such as politics, marketing, tourism, among others. Actually, healthcare domain implies a large area of opportunity to obtain benefits using sentiment analysis, such as obtaining information about the patients’ mood, diseases, adverse drug reactions, epidemics, among others. However, healthcare domain has been very little explored. Therefore, in this chapter we propose a module based on sentiment analysis to obtain sentiments and emotions at the comment and entity levels from texts related to the healthcare domain. Also, different case studies are presented to validate the proposed module. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,"Secretaría de Educación Pública, SEP

Monitoring social media platforms has recently fascinated medical natural language processing researchers to detect various medical abnormalities such as adverse drug reaction. In this paper, we present a benchmark setup for analyzing the sentiment with respect to users' medical condition considering the information, available in social media in particular. To this end, we have crawled the medical forum website 'patient.info' with opinions about medical condition self narrated by the users. We constrained ourselves to some of the popular domains such as depression, anxiety, asthma, and allergy. The focus is given on the identification of multiple forms of medical sentiments which can be inferred from users' medical condition, treatment, and medication. Thereafter, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based medical sentiment analysis system is developed for the purpose of evaluation. The resources are made available to the community through LRE map for further research. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

A typical setting is pharmacovigilance (PV). The manual detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in narrative reports is time consuming and natural language processing (NLP) provides a concrete help to PV experts. In this paper, we carry out experiments for testing performances of MagiCoder, an NLP application designed to extract MedDRA terms from narrative clinical text. Given a narrative description, MagiCoder proposes an automatic encoding. The pharmacologist reviews, (possibly) corrects, and then, validates the solution. This drastically reduces the time needed for the validation of reports with respect to a completely manual encoding. In previous work, we mainly tested MagiCoder performances on Italian written spontaneous reports. In this paper, we include some new features, change the experiment design, and carry on more tests about MagiCoder. Moreover, we do a change of language, moving to English documents. In particular, we tested MagiCoder on the CADEC dataset, a corpus of manually annotated posts about ADRs collected from the social media. © 2013 IEEE.","adverse drug reactions; healthcare informatics; Natural language processing; pharmacovigilance; term identification","Computer software; Diagnosis; Encoding (symbols); Glossaries; Job analysis; Medical imaging; Pharmacodynamics; Signal encoding; Adverse drug reactions; Drugs; Health care informatics; Informatics; Medical diagnostic imaging; Pharmacovigilance; Task analysis; Natural language processing systems; accuracy; algorithm; anaphylaxis; Article; book; English (language); grammar; human; hypotension; knowledge; language; machine learning; mathematical model; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; natural language processing; physician; side effect; social media; adverse drug reaction; data mining; drug surveillance program; medical informatics; procedures; Data Mining; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance",,,,,,,,"Meystre, S., Haug, P.J., Natural language processing to extract medical problems from electronic clinical documents: Performance evaluation (2006) J.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare perceptions about chemotherapy of patients and health-care providers through analysis of chemo-related tweets. Materials and methods: Cancer-related Twitter accounts and their tweets were obtained through using Tweepy (Python library). Multiple text classification algorithms were tested to identify the models with best performance in classifying the accounts into individual and organization. Chemotherapy-specific tweets were extracted from historical tweetset, and the content of these tweets was analyzed using topic model, sentiment analysis and word co-occurrence network. Results: Using the description in Twitter users’ profiles, the accounts related with cancer were collected and coded as individual or organization. We employed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with GloVe word embeddings to identify the user into individuals and organizations with accuracy of 85.2%. 13, 273 and 14,051 publicly available chemotherapy-related tweets were retrieved from individuals and organizations, respectively. The content of the chemo-related tweets was analyzed by text mining approaches. The tweets from individual accounts pertained to personal chemotherapy experience and emotions. In contrast with the personal users, professional accounts had a higher proportion of neutral tweets about side effects. The information about the assessment of response to chemotherapy was deficient from organizations on Twitter. Discussion: Examining chemotherapy discussions on Twitter provide new lens into content and behavioral patterns associated with treatments for cancer patients. The methodology described herein allowed us to collect relatively large number of health-related tweets over a greater time period and exploit the potential power of social media, which provide comprehensive view on patients’ perceptions of chemotherapy. Conclusion: This study sheds light on using Twitter data as a valuable healthcare data source for helping oncologists (organizations) in understanding patients’ experiences while undergoing chemotherapy, in developing personalize therapy plans, and a supplement to the clinical electronic medical records (EMRs). © 2018","Cancer; Chemotherapy; Deep learning; Side effect; Social media; Twitter","Chemotherapy; Classification (of information); Deep learning; Diseases; Long short-term memory; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Text processing; Behavioral patterns; Cancer; Electronic medical records (EMRs); Health care providers; Side effect; Social media; Social media platforms; Twitter; Data mining; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; classification algorithm; data analysis; electronic medical record; embedding; emotion; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; medical information; organization; perception; priority journal; social media; twitter; adverse drug reaction; health behavior; neoplasm; procedures; psychology; social media; statistics and numerical data; antineoplastic agent; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Health Behavior; Health Communication; Humans; Neoplasms; Social Media",,"Antineoplastic Agents",,,,,,"De Martino, I., D'Apolito, R., McLawhorn, A.S., Fehring, K.A., Sculco, P.K., Gasparini, G., Social media for patients: benefits and drawbacks (2017) Curr.

An additional objective was to publicly release manually annotated data. Materials and Methods We organized 3 independent subtasks: Automatic classification of self-reports of 1) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 2) medication consumption, from medication-mentioning tweets, and 3) normalization of ADR expressions. Training data consisted of 15 717 annotated tweets for (1), 10 260 for (2), and 6650 ADR phrases and identifiers for (3); and exhibited typical properties of social-media-based health-related texts. Systems were evaluated using 9961, 7513, and 2500 instances for the 3 subtasks, respectively. We evaluated performances of classes of methods and ensembles of system combinations following the shared tasks. Results Among 55 system runs, the best system scores for the 3 subtasks were 0.435 (ADR class F 1-score) for subtask-1, 0.693 (micro-Averaged F 1-score over two classes) for subtask-2, and 88.5% (accuracy) for subtask-3. Ensembles of system combinations obtained best scores of 0.476, 0.702, and 88.7%, outperforming individual systems. Discussion Among individual systems, support vector machines and convolutional neural networks showed high performance. Performance gains achieved by ensembles of system combinations suggest that such strategies may be suitable for operational systems relying on difficult text classification tasks (eg, subtask-1). Conclusions Data imbalance and lack of context remain challenges for natural language processing of social media text. Annotated data from the shared task have been made available as reference standards for future studies (http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/rxwfb3tysd.1). © © The Author(s) 2018.

We grouped the data into four types (synthetic, drug labels, social data, and clinical data) which are correlated with size and sensitivity. We found named entity recognition and classification to be the most common tasks. Most of the methods used to tackle the shared tasks have been data-driven. There is homogeneity in the methods used to tackle the named entity recognition tasks, while more diverse solutions are investigated for relation extraction, multi-class classification, and information retrieval problems.CONCLUSIONS:  There is a clear trend in using data-driven methods to tackle problems in clinical NLP. The availability of more and varied data from different institutions will undoubtedly lead to bigger advances in the field, for the benefit of healthcare as a whole.

Recently, it has gained prominence due to the increasing amount of data suggesting that a large amount of patient harm is preventable and can be mitigated with effective risk strategies that have not been sufficiently adopted. Adverse events from medications are part of clinical practice, but the ability to identify a patient's risk and to minimize that risk must be a priority. The ability to identify adverse events has been a challenge due to limitations of available data sources, which are often free text. The use of natural language processing (NLP) may help to address these limitations. NLP is the artificial intelligence domain of computer science that uses computers to manipulate unstructured data (i.e., narrative text or speech data) in the context of a specific task. In this narrative review, we illustrate the fundamentals of NLP and discuss NLP's application to medication safety in four data sources: electronic health records, Internet-based data, published literature, and reporting systems. Given the magnitude of available data from these sources, a growing area is the use of computer algorithms to help automatically detect associations between medications and adverse effects. The main benefit of NLP is in the time savings associated with automation of various medication safety tasks such as the medication reconciliation process facilitated by computers, as well as the potential for near–real-time identification of adverse events for postmarketing surveillance such as those posted on social media that would otherwise go unanalyzed. NLP is limited by a lack of data sharing between health care organizations due to insufficient interoperability capabilities, inhibiting large-scale adverse event monitoring across populations. We anticipate that future work in this area will focus on the integration of data sources from different domains to improve the ability to identify potential adverse events more quickly and to improve clinical decision support with regard to a patient's estimated risk for specific adverse events at the time of medication prescription or review. © 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","adverse drug reaction reporting systems; electronic health records; medical informatics; natural language processing; patient safety; pharmacovigilance; social media; supervised machine learning","algorithm; clinical decision support system; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; drug safety; electronic health record; human; Internet; natural language processing; pharmacist; postmarketing surveillance; prescription; Review; risk reduction; social media; adverse drug reaction; drug surveillance program; publication; statistics and numerical data; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Internet; Natural Language Processing; Periodicals as Topic",,,,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ: R01HS022728","Funding: This study was supported by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality grant (R01HS022728).",,"Sulfanilamide disaster, , https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/productregulation/sulfanilamidedisaster/, Available from, Accessed October 1, 2017; Laatikainen, O., Miettunen, J., Sneck, S., Lehtiniemi, H., Tenhunen, O., Turpeinen, M., The prevalence of medication-related adverse events in inpatients – a systematic review and meta-analysis (2017) Eur J Clin Pharmacol, 73, pp. 1539-1549; Lazarou, J., Pomeranz, B.H., Corey, P.N., Incidence of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients: a meta-analysis of prospective studies (1998) JAMA, 279, pp. 1200-1205; Federico, F., The five rights of medication administration, , http://www.ihi.org/resources/Pages/ImprovementStories/FiveRightsofMedicationAdministration.aspx, Available from, Accessed October 2, 2017; Cornish, P.L., Knowles, S.R., Marchesano, R., Unintended medication discrepancies at the time of hospital admission (2005) Arch Intern Med, 165, pp. 424-429; Simpson, S.H., Eurich, D.T., Majumdar, S.R., A meta-analysis of the association between adherence to drug therapy and mortality (2006) BMJ, 333, p. 15; van Dulmen, S., Slujis, E., van Dijk, L., de Ridder, D., Heerdink, R., Bensing, J., Patient adherence to medical treatment: a review of reviews (2007) BMC Health Serv Res, 7, p. 55; Bates, D.W., Teich, J.M., Lee, J., The impact of computerized physician order entry on medication error prevention (1999) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 6, pp. 313-321; English glossary, , http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/coordination/English_Glossary.pdf, Available from, Accessed October 1, 2017; FDA adverse event reporting system, , https://open.fda.gov/data/faers/, Available from, Accessed October 1, 2017; Luo, Y., Thompson, W.K., Herr, T.M., Natural language processing for EHR-based pharmacovigilance: a structured review (2017) Drug Saf, 40, pp. 1075-1089; Hirschberg, J., Manning, C.D., Advances in natural language processing (2015) Science, 349, pp. 261-266; Friedman, C., Hripcsak, G., Natural language processing and its future in medicine (1999) Acad Med, 74, pp. 890-895; Nadkharni, P., Ohno-Machado, L., Chapman, W.W., Natural language processing: an introduction (2011) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 18, pp. 544-551; Sapir, E., (1921) Language: an introduction to the study of speech, , New York, NY, Harcourt Brace; Halpern, Y., Horng, S., Choi, Y., Sontag, D., Electronic medical record phenotyping using the anchor and learn framework (2016) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 23, pp. 731-740; Botsis, T., Nguyen, M.D., Woo, E.J., Markatou, M., Ball, R., Text mining for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: medical text classification using informative feature selection (2011) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 18, pp. 631-638; IBM's Watson computer takes the Jeopardy!

Data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, content summarization and natural language processing techniques are often used in this field with promising results. However, there are still several difficulties concerning the extraction, as the highly domain-specific vocabulary presents a few challenges. This is mainly because patients like to use idiomatic or vernacular expressions along with descriptive symptom explanations, which tend to deviate from grammatical rules or expected terms. To address this issue, we propose a well-curated baseline. We believe that building a specific lexicon, identifying common linguistic patterns and observing certain phrasal structures is key to first understanding how a user generates contents online. From there, we can later develop sets of tailored rules that will allow data classification/extraction systems to potentially improve their efficiency at these tasks. © 2018 IEEE.","adverse effects; information extraction; natural language processing; pharmacovigilance","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Information retrieval; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Pattern recognition; Adverse effect; Data classification; Domain specific; Linguistic patterns; Natural languages; Pharmacovigilance; User experience; User-generated; Data mining",,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work was supported by Project NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000016 (NanoSTIMA), which is financed by the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement, and through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)",,"(2018) World Health Organization - Pharmacovigilance Definition, , http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/qualitysafety/safetyefficacy/pharmvigi/en/, accessed January 5, 2018; Organization, W.H., (2002) The Importance of Pharmacovigilance; Benton, A., Ungar, L., Hill, S., Hennessy, S., Mao, J., Chung, A., Leonard, C.E., Holmes, J.H., Identifying potential adverse effects using the web: A new approach to medical hypothesis generation (2011) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 44 (6), pp. 989-996; Blenkinsopp, A., Wilkie, P., Wang, M., Routledge, P.A., Patient reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions: A review of published literature and international experience (2007) British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 63 (2), pp. 148-156; Li, Y.A., (2011) Medical Data Mining: Improving Information Accessibility Using Online Patient Drug Reviews, , Ph.D. dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Aramaki, E., Miura, Y., Tonoike, M., Ohkuma, T., Masuichi, H., Waki, K., Ohe, K., Extraction of adverse drug effects from clinical records (2010) MedInfo, pp. 739-743; Friedman, C., Discovering novel adverse drug events using natural language processing and mining of the electronic health record (2009) Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine in Europe, pp. 1-5. , Springer; Wang, X., Hripcsak, G., Markatou, M., Friedman, C., Active computerized pharmacovigilance using natural language processing, statistics, and electronic health records: A feasibility study (2009) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 16 (3), pp. 328-337; Lardon, J., Abdellaoui, R., Bellet, F., Asfari, H., Souvignet, J., Texier, N., Jaulent, M.-C., Bousquet, C., Adverse drug reaction identification and extraction in social media: A scoping review (2015) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 17 (7); Freifeld, C.C., Brownstein, J.S., Menone, C.M., Bao, W., Filice, R., Kass-Hout, T., Dasgupta, N., Digital drug safety surveillance: Monitoring pharmaceutical products in twitter (2014) Drug Safety, 37 (5), pp. 343-350; Ginn, R., Pimpalkhute, P., Nikfarjam, A., Patki, A., O'Connor, K., Sarker, A., Smith, K., Gonzalez, G., Mining twitter for adverse drug reaction mentions: A corpus and classification benchmark (2014) Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Building and Evaluating Resources for Health and Biomedical Text Processing.

The tweets containing fentanyl as keyword were retrieved from Twitter social media. The tweets were preprocessed in order to make them ready for the analysis. The sentiment analysis algorithm labeled 1927 tweets (41.85 %) as negative, 2067 tweets (44.9 %) as neutral and 610 (13.25 %) tweets as positive. Crisis, dead, death, die, dose, drug, heroin, kill, lethal, opioid, overdose and police were some of the words frequently associated with fentanyl. The high correlation and association of fentanyl with these terms identified by association rule algorithms demonstrated fentanyl abuse and aftermaths in the real world. This study could further be extended to study the region- and population-wise fentanyl misuse and side effects by adding location and user demographic information, which possibly could help in developing drug abuse prevention programs. © 2018 OMICS International.

Objective: Our objective in the ADR-PRISM project was to provide text mining and visualization tools to explore a corpus of posts extracted from social media. We evaluated this approach on a corpus of 21 million posts from five patient forums, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the data available on methylphenidate in this corpus. Methods: We applied text mining methods based on named entity recognition and relation extraction in the corpus, followed by signal detection using proportional reporting ratio (PRR). We also used topic modeling based on the Correlated Topic Model to obtain the list of the matics in the corpus and classify the messages based on their topics. Results: We automatically identified 3443 posts about methylphenidate published between 2007 and 2016, among which 61 adverse drug reactions (ADR) were automatically detected. Two pharmacovigilance experts evaluated manually the quality of automatic identification, and a f-measure of 0.57 was reached. Patient's reports were mainly neuro-psychiatric effects. Applying PRR, 67% of the ADRs were signals, including most of the neuro-psychiatric symptoms but also palpitations. Topic modeling showed that the most represented topics were related to Childhood and Treatment initiation, but also Side effects. Cases of misuse were also identified in this corpus, including recreational use and abuse. Conclusion: Named entity recognition combined with signal detection and topic modeling have demonstrated their complementarity in mining social media data. An in-depth analysis focused on methylphenidate showed that this approach was able to detect potential signals and to provide better understanding of patients' behaviors regarding drugs, including misuse. © 2018 Chen, Faviez, Schuck, Lillo-Le-Louët, Texier, Dahamna, Huot, Foulquié, Pereira, Leroux, Karapetiantz, Guenegou-Arnoux, Katsahian, Bousquet and Burgun.","Data mining; Drug misuse; Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions; Methylphenidate; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social media","methylphenidate; abnormal behavior; acne; aggression; anger; anxiety; Article; attention disturbance; body weight gain; convulsion; crying; data mining; defense mechanism; delusion; dependent personality disorder; drug hypersensitivity; drug misuse; drug safety; drug surveillance program; dyslexia; fatigue; headache; heart palpitation; heart sound; human; insomnia; irritability; loss of appetite; malaise; malignant neoplasm; mood disorder; muscle spasm; nausea; nervousness; neurologic disease; neuropsychological test; pain; paranoia; patient-reported outcome; psychomotor disorder; psychosis; side effect; signal detection; sleep disorder; sleep quality; social media; stress; substance abuse; tic",,"methylphenidate, 113-45-1, 298-59-9","concerta; medikinet; quasym; ritalin; ritaline",,,,,"Ahmed, I., Thiessard, F., Miremont-Salamé, G., Bégaud, B., Tubert-Bitter, P., Pharmacovigilance data mining with methods based on false discovery rates: a comparative simulation study (2010) Clin.

Many DL based approaches have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks that are of great importance to online social networks (OSN) and social computing such as sentiment analysis (SA) and pharmacovigilance. NLP tasks are becoming very prominent in OSN and DL is offering researchers and practitioners exciting new directions to address these tasks. In this paper, we provide a survey of the published papers on using DL techniques for NLP. We focus on the Arabic language due to its importance, the scarcity of resources on it and the challenges associated with working on it. We notice that DL has yet to receive the attention it deserves from the Arabic NLP (ANLP) community compared with the attention it is getting for other languages despite the vast adoption of social networks in the Arab world. The majority of the early works on using DL for ANLP focused on OCR-related problems while the more recent ones are more diverse with the increasing interest in applying DL to SA, machine translation, diacritization, etc. This survey should serve as a guide for the young and growing ANLP community in order to help bridge the huge gap between ANLP literature and the much richer and more mature English NLP literature. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Arabic natural language processing; Deep learning; Machine translation; Optical character recognition; Sentiment analysis; Social computing; Speech analysis; Text categorization; Text recognition","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Optical character recognition; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Speech recognition; Speech transmission; Surveys; Text processing; Arabic natural language processing; Machine translations; Social computing; Text categorization; Text recognition; Deep learning",,,,,,,,"Farzindar, A., Inkpen, D., Natural language processing for social media (2015) Synth.

In particular, drug reactions can be extracted from user reviews posted on the Web, and automated processing of this information represents a novel and exciting approach to personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. In medical applications, demographic information regarding the authors of these reviews such as age and gender is of primary importance; however, existing studies usually either assume that this information is available or overlook the issue entirely. In this work, we propose and compare several approaches to automated mining of demographic information from user-generated texts. We compare modern natural language processing techniques, including extensions of topic models and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We apply single-task and multi-task learning approaches to this problem. Based on a real-world dataset mined from a health-related web site, we conclude that while CNNs perform best in terms of predicting demographic information by jointly learning different user attributes, topic models provide additional information and reflect gender-specific and age-specific symptom profiles that may be of interest for a researcher. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Demographic attributes; Demographic prediction; Mental health; Multi-task learning; Natural language processing; Single-task learning; Social media; Text mining; Topic modeling; User reviews","Convolution; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical applications; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Population statistics; Convolutional neural network; Demographic attributes; Demographic predictions; Mental health; Multitask learning; Single task learning; Social media; Text mining; Topic Modeling; User reviews; Data mining",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 15-11-10019","Acknowledgements This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant no. 15-11-10019.

Despite its popularity, it is not always clear what big data refers to exactly. Big data has become a very popular topic in healthcare, where the term primarily refers to the vast and growing volumes of computerized medical information available in the form of electronic health records, administrative or health claims data, disease and drug monitoring registries and so on. This kind of data is generally collected routinely during administrative processes and clinical practice by different healthcare professionals: from doctors recording their patients’ medical history, drug prescriptions or medical claims to pharmacists registering dispensed prescriptions. For a long time, this data accumulated without its value being fully recognized and leveraged. Today big data has an important place in healthcare, including in pharmacovigilance. The expanding role of big data in pharmacovigilance includes signal detection, substantiation and validation of drug or vaccine safety signals, and increasingly new sources of information such as social media are also being considered. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the uses of big data for drug safety post-marketing assessment. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,"serotonin uptake inhibitor; tricyclic antidepressant agent; vaccine; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; data base; data mining; data processing; drug information; drug safety; drug surveillance program; electronic health record; health care; human; International Classification of Diseases; machine learning; medical history; medical information; medical record; natural language processing; pharmacist; physician; prescription; priority journal; register; signal detection; social media; validation process; adverse drug reaction; drug surveillance program; factual database; health care delivery; statistics and numerical data; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Delivery of Health Care; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media",,,,,"Amgen

In particular, new drug pharmacological properties can be derived patient observations shared in social media forums. Developing approaches designed to automatically retrieve this information is of no low interest for personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. The full potential of the effective exploitation of both textual data and published biological data for drug research often goes untapped mostly because of the lack of tools and focused methodologies to curate and integrate the data and transform it into new, experimentally testable hypotheses. Deep learning architectures have shown promising results for a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose to address a challenging problem by applying modern deep neural networks for disease named entity recognition. An essential step for this task is recognition of disease mentions and medical concept nor-malization, which is highly difficult with simple string matching approaches. We cast the task as an end-to-end problem, solved using two architectures based on recurrent neural networks and pre-trained word embeddings. We show that it is possible to assess the practicability of using social media data to extract representative medical concepts for pharmacovigilance or drug repurposing. © 2017 IEEE.","deep learning; disease named entity extraction; disease named entity normalization; healthcare; Medical systems; recurrent neural networks","Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Health care; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Social networking (online); Health care application; Learning architectures; Medical systems; Named entity extraction; Named entity normalizations; Named entity recognition; Personalized medicines; Pharmacological properties; Recurrent neural networks",,,,,"Russian Science Foundation, RSF: 15-11-10019","The work on problem definition and neural networks was supported by the Russian Science Foundation grant no. 15-11-10019.

In general, the ADR detection process consists of 4 steps: (1) data collection from social media; (2) classification/filtering of ADR assertive text segments; (3) extraction of ADR mentions from text segments; (4) analysis of extracted ADR mentions for signal generation. The implementation of each step in the Russian-language environment is associated with a number of difficulties in comparison with the traditional English-speaking environment. First of all, they are connected with the lack of necessary databases and specialized language resources. In addition, an important negative role is played by the complex grammatical structure of the Russian language. The authors present various methods of machine learning algorithms adaptation in order to overcome these difficulties. For step 3 on the material of Russian-language text forums using the ensemble classifier, the Accuracy = 0.805 was obtained. For step 4 on the material of Russian-language EHR, by adapting pyConTextNLP, the F-measure = 0.935 was obtained, and by adapting ConText algorithm, the F-measure = 0.92–0.95 was obtained. A method for full-scale performing of step 4 was developed using cue-based and rule-based approaches, and the F-measure = 67.5% was obtained that is quite comparable to baseline. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Adverse drug reaction; Natural language processing; Russian-language text content","Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Pharmacodynamics; Adverse drug reactions; Detection process; Ensemble classifiers; Grammatical structure; Language resources; Rule-based approach; Signal generation; Text content; Text processing",,,,,"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka: 03/10/2016, 14.578.21.0196

This paper presents a mysterious analysis of pharmacovigilance from reviewers using NLP cloud environment. The historical and comparative methods upon doctors’ prescription data and analysis are performed in the NLP (Natural Language Processing) cloud. For improving analysis of pharmacovigilance in medical research our system of approach not only explains the healthcare monitoring system but also scalable psychoanalysis of medical data. The system of approach explored by the variation of offline and online feedbacks of patients and it reveals through sentimental analysis in the NLP cloud system. Pharmacovigilance in NLP cloud analysis process identified the emotional analysis of the patient medicine intake data. The existing conventional methods of pharmacovigilance are taken upon clinical trials and small groups of tests data. The comparison result helps to find quicker analysis of medicine intake of the patients and protect from adverse drug event. Our approach will gain with the effort by the pharmacovigilance in cloud for patients. This innovation furnishes patients and specialists with openness to data that can enhance healthcare by investigating the primary as well as secondary data. A novelty approach which will make better service for tablets and pharma products in the medical field and as well as avoids overdosage and adverse effect event.

Pharmacovigilance tracks and monitors safe use of pharmaceutical products. Pharmacovigilance involves tracking side effects that may be caused by medicines and other health related drugs. Medical professionals have a difficult time collecting this information. It is anticipated that social media could help to collect this data and track side effects. Twitter data can be used for this task given that users post their personal health related experiences on-line. One problem with Twitter data, however, is that it contains a lot of noise. Therefore, an approach is needed to remove the noise. In this paper, several machine learning algorithms including deep neural nets are used to build classifiers that can help to detect these Personal Experience Tweets (PETs).

In recent years, increasing numbers of scientific articles and health-related social media posts have been generated and shared daily, albeit with very limited use for ADE study and with little known about the content with respect to ADEs. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a big data analytics strategy that mines the content of scientific articles and health-related Web-based social media to detect and identify ADEs. Methods: We analyzed the following two data sources: (1) biomedical articles and (2) health-related social media blog posts. We developed an intelligent and scalable text mining solution on big data infrastructures composed of Apache Spark, natural language processing, and machine learning. This was combined with an Elasticsearch No-SQL distributed database to explore and visualize ADEs. Results: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under receiver operating characteristic of the system were 92.7%, 93.6%, 93.0%, and 0.905, respectively, and showed better results in comparison with traditional approaches in the literature. This work not only detected and classified ADE sentences from big data biomedical literature but also scientifically visualized ADE interactions. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate a big data machine learning strategy for ADE discovery on massive datasets downloaded from PubMed Central and social media. This contribution illustrates possible capacities in big data biomedical text analysis using advanced computational methods with real-time update from new data published on a daily basis. © 2017 Consilium Medikum.

Classical Pharmacovigilance process is limited by underreporting which justifies the current interest in new knowledge sources such as social media. The Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media (ADR-PRISM) project aims to extract ADRs reported by patients in these media. We identified 5 major challenges to overcome to operationalize the analysis of patient posts: (1) variable quality of information on social media, (2) guarantee of data privacy, (3) response to pharmacovigilance expert expectations, (4) identification of relevant information within Web pages, and (5) robust and evolutive architecture. Objective: This article aims to describe the current state of advancement of the ADR-PRISM project by focusing on the solutions we have chosen to address these 5 major challenges. Methods: In this article, we propose methods and describe the advancement of this project on several aspects: (1) a quality driven approach for selecting relevant social media for the extraction of knowledge on potential ADRs, (2) an assessment of ethical issues and French regulation for the analysis of data on social media, (3) an analysis of pharmacovigilance expert requirements when reviewing patient posts on the Internet, (4) an extraction method based on natural language processing, pattern based matching, and selection of relevant medical concepts in reference terminologies, and (5) specifications of a component-based architecture for the monitoring system. Results: Considering the 5 major challenges, we (1) selected a set of 21 validated criteria for selecting social media to support the extraction of potential ADRs, (2) proposed solutions to guarantee data privacy of patients posting on Internet, (3) took into account pharmacovigilance expert requirements with use case diagrams and scenarios, (4) built domain-specific knowledge resources embeding a lexicon, morphological rules, context rules, semantic rules, syntactic rules, and post-analysis processing, and (5) proposed a component-based architecture that allows storage of big data and accessibility to third-party applications through Web services. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a component-based architecture that allows collection of patient posts on the Internet, near real-time processing of those posts including annotation, and storage in big data structures. In the next steps, we will evaluate the posts identified by the system in social media to clarify the interest and relevance of such approach to improve conventional pharmacovigilance processes based on spontaneous reporting. © Cedric Bousquet, Badisse Dahamna, Sylvie Guillemin-Lanne, Stefan J Darmoni, Carole Faviez, Charles Huot, Sandrine Katsahian, Vincent Leroux, Suzanne Pereira, Christophe Richard, Stéphane Schück, Julien Souvignet, Agnès Lillo-Le Louët, Nathalie Texier.

To find a larger sample of reports, a possible way is to mine online social media. With its current widespread use, social media such as Twitter has given rise to massive amounts of data, which can be used as reports for drug side effects. To process these large datasets, Apache Spark has become popular for fast, distributed batch processing. In this work, we have improved on previous pipelines in sentimental analysis-based mining, processing, and extracting tweets with drug-caused side effects. We have also added a new ensemble classifier using a combination of sentiment analysis features to increase the accuracy of identifying drug-caused side effects. In addition, the frequency count for the side effects is also provided. Furthermore, we have also implemented the same pipeline in Apache Spark to improve the speed of processing of tweets by 2.5 times, as well as to support the process of large tweet datasets. As the frequency count of drug side effects opens a wide door for further analysis, we present a preliminary study on this issue, including the side effects of simultaneously using two drugs, and the potential danger of using less-common combination of drugs. We believe the pipeline design and the results present in this work would have great implication on studying drug side effects and on big data analysis in general. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adverse drug event;

This paper treats adverse drug reactions as named entities based on the discriminant model of Conditional Random Field, and designs a recognition framework based on social media. In the experimental part, adverse drug reactions are identified by mining the user's tweets on the Twitter, and seek to further improve the accuracy and normalization by mapping them to the existing dictionaries. The results show that the recognition mechanism provides a certain reference for medical text mining, which contributes to promoting the process of medical informatization. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Adverse Drug Reaction; Conditional Random Field; Named Entity Recognition","Character recognition; Data mining; Information management; Natural language processing systems; Random processes; Social networking (online); Text processing; Adverse drug reactions; Conditional random field; Discriminant models; Medical treatment; Monitoring costs; Named entity recognition; Recognition efficiency; Recognition mechanism; Pharmacodynamics",,,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality: 9142014","This paper is supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 9142014) ""The situational awareness research of multi-source information fusion based on Beijing public crisis""",,"(1972) International Drug Monitoring: The Role of National Centres, Report of A WHO Meeting, , World Health Organization.

Human review of social media data is infeasible due to data quantity, thus natural language processing techniques are necessary. Social media includes informal vocabulary and irregular grammar, which challenge natural language processing methods. Our objective is to develop a scalable, deep-learning approach that exceeds state-of-the-art ADR detection performance in social media. Materials and Methods: We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that labels words in an input sequence with ADR membership tags. The only input features are word-embedding vectors, which can be formed through task-independent pretraining or during ADR detection training. Results: Our best-performing RNN model used pretrained word embeddings created from a large, non- domain-specific Twitter dataset. It achieved an approximate match F-measure of 0.755 for ADR identification on the dataset, compared to 0.631 for a baseline lexicon system and 0.65 for the state-of-the-art conditional random field model. Feature analysis indicated that semantic information in pretrained word embeddings boosted sensitivity and, combined with contextual awareness captured in the RNN, precision. Discussion: Our model required no task-specific feature engineering, suggesting generalizability to additional sequence-labeling tasks. Learning curve analysis showed that our model reached optimal performance with fewer training examples than the other models. Conclusion: ADR detection performance in social media is significantly improved by using a contextually aware model and word embeddings formed from large, unlabeled datasets. The approach reduces manual datalabeling requirements and is scalable to large social media datasets. © The Author 2017.

Here, we used social media data to examine IBD patients' understanding of the risks and benefits associated with biologic therapies and how this affects decision-making. Methods: We collected posts from Twitter and e-forum discussions from >3000 social media sites posted between June 27, 2012 and June 27, 2015. Guided by natural language processing, we identified posts with specific IBD keywords that discussed the risks and/or benefits of biologics. We then manually coded the resulting posts and performed qualitative analysis using ATLAS.ti software. A hierarchical coding structure was developed based on the keyword list and relevant themes were identified through manual coding. Results: We examined 1598 IBD-related posts, of which 452 (28.3%) centered on the risks and/or benefits of biologics. There were 5 main themes: negative experiences and concerns with biologics (n = 247; 54.6%), decision-making surrounding biologic use (n = 169; 37.4%), positive experiences with biologics (n = 168; 37.2%), information seeking from peers (n = 125; 27.7%), and cost (n = 38; 8.4%). Posts describing negative experiences primarily commented on side effects from biologics, concerns about potential side effects and increased cancer risk, and pregnancy safety concerns. Posts on decision-making focused on nonbiologic treatment options, hesitation to initiate biologics, and concerns about changing or discontinuing regimens. Conclusions: Social media reveals a wide range of themes governing patients' experience and choice with IBD biologics. The complexity of navigating their risk-benefit profiles suggests merit in creating online tailored decision tools to support IBD patients' decision-making with biologic therapies.

A diverse set of techniques from epidemiology, statistics, and computer science are being proposed and studied for ADE discovery from observational health data (e.g., EHR and claims data), social network data (e.g., Google and Twitter posts), and other information sources. Methodologies are needed for evaluating, quantitatively measuring and comparing the ability of these various approaches to accurately discover ADEs. This work is motivated by the observation that text sources such as the Medline/Medinfo library provide a wealth of information on human health. Unfortunately, ADEs often result from unexpected interactions, and the connection between conditions and drugs is not explicit in these sources. Thus, in this work, we address the question of whether we can quantitatively estimate relationships between drugs and conditions from the medical literature. This paper proposes and studies a state-of-the-art NLP-based extraction of ADEs from text. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Adverse drug event extraction; Markov logic networks; Natural language processing; Statistical relational learning","Extraction; Information analysis; Markov processes; Natural language processing systems; Probabilistic logics; Event extraction; Information sources; Markov logic networks; Medical literatures; Medical profession; NAtural language processing; Statistical relational learning; Wealth of information; Computer circuits",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Objective: This study aimed to provide a comparable corpus of texts from PubMed and Twitter that can be used to study drug reports from these two sources of information, allowing researchers in the area of pharmacovigilance using natural language processing (NLP) to perform experiments to better understand the similarities and differences between drug reports in Twitter and PubMed. Methods: We produced a corpus comprising 1000 tweets and 1000 PubMed sentences selected using the same strategy and annotated at entity level by the same experts (pharmacists) using the same set of guidelines. Results: The resulting corpus, annotated by two pharmacists, comprises semantically correct annotations for a set of drugs, diseases, and symptoms. This corpus contains the annotations for 3144 entities, 2749 relations, and 5003 attributes. Conclusions: We present a corpus that is unique in its characteristics as this is the first corpus for pharmacovigilance curated from Twitter messages and PubMed sentences using the same data selection and annotation strategies. We believe this corpus will be of particular interest for researchers willing to compare results from pharmacovigilance systems (eg, classifiers and named entity recognition systems) when using data from Twitter and from PubMed. We hope that given the comprehensive set of drug names and the annotated entities and relations, this corpus becomes a standard resource to compare results from different pharmacovigilance studies in the area of NLP. © Nestor Alvaro, Yusuke Miyao, Nigel Collier.

Automatic extraction of ADR information can be crucial for healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and consumers. However, because of the non-standard nature of social media language, automatically extracted ADR mentions need to be mapped to standard forms before they can be used by operational pharmacovigilance systems. We propose a modular natural language processing pipeline for mapping (normalizing) colloquial mentions of ADRs to their corresponding standardized identifiers. We seek to accomplish this task and enable customization of the pipeline so that distinct unlabeled free text resources can be incorporated to use the system for other normalization tasks. Our approach, which we call Hybrid Semantic Analysis (HSA), sequentially employs rule-based and semantic matching algorithms for mapping user-generated mentions to concept IDs in the Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. The semantic matching component of HSA is adaptive in nature and uses a regression model to combine various measures of semantic relatedness and resources to optimize normalization performance on the selected data source. On a publicly available corpus, our normalization method achieves 0.502 recall and 0.823 precision (F-measure: 0.624).

Now, it has started automating health care domain through Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision applications. As a part of it, researchers are now focusing more on mining health related information from the text shared through social media and clinical trials. This paper explains about our system for health care text classification tasks conducted by Health Language Processing (HLP) Lab. We experimented with representing the target classes available in task 1 and task 2 as vectors. The classification has been performed using Support Vector Machine. To compute the representation for target classes, we used traditional methods available in Vector Space Models and Vector Space Models of Semantics. In this shared task, the task 1 is about distinguishing the tweets mentioning ""adverse drug reaction"" from the ones which do not. The task 2 is about distinguishing the tweets that includes personal medication intake, possible medication intake and non-intake. The preliminary results are satisfying in-order to continue the research in developing a representation method for target classes.",,"Classification (of information); Health care; Medical computing; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Social networking (online); Vector spaces; Vectors; Adverse drug reactions; Clinical trial; Computer vision applications; Health related informations; Language processing; Representation method; Text classification; Vector space models; Text processing",,,,,,,,"Barathi, G.H.B., Anand, K.M., Soman, K.P., Distributional semantic representation in health care text classification (2016) Working Notes of FIRE 2016 - Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation, pp. 201-204. , http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1737/T5-3.pdf, Kolkata, India, December 7-10; Barathi, G.H.B., Anand, K.M., Soman, K.P., (2017) Vector Space Model as Cognitive Space for Text Classification, , http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06068, arXiv; Ioannis, A., Gallopoulos, E., (2006) Exploring Term-document Matrices from Matrix Models in Text Mining, , arXiv preprint; Juan, R., Using tf-idf to determine word relevance in document queries (2003) Proceedings of the First Instructional Conference on Machine Learning; Landauer, T.K., Latent semantic analysis (2006) Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science; Barathi, G.H.B., Anand, K.M., Soman, K.P., (2016) Statistical Semantics in Context Space, Working Notes of CLEF 2016 - Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum, pp. 881-889. , http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1609/16090881.pdf, Evora, Portugal, 5-8 September; Cha, S.-H., (2007) Comprehensive Survey on Distance/similarity Measures between Probability Density Functions, , City; Sarker, A., Gonzalez, G., Portable automatic text classification for adverse drug reaction detectionvia multi-corpus training (2015) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 53, pp. 196-207; Klein, A., Sarker, A., Rouhizadeh, M., O'Connor, K., Gonzalez, G., Detecting personal medication intake in twitter: An annotated corpus and baseline classification system (2017) BioNLP, pp. 136-142. , 2017",,"Sarker A.Gonzalez G.","","CEUR-WS","2nd Social Media Mining for Health Research and Applications Workshop, SMM4H 2017","4 November 2017",,131897,16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037059797

These initiatives include the development of data mining systems and the preparation of datasets that can be used to train such systems. The overarching focus of the SMM4H shared tasks is to release annotated social media based health related datasets to the research community, and to compare the performances of distinct natural language processing and machine learning systems on tasks involving these datasets. The second execution of the SMM4H shared tasks comprised of three subtasks involving annotated user posts from Twitter (tweets): (i) automatic classification of tweets mentioning an adverse drug reaction (ADR) (ii) automatic classification of tweets containing reports of first-person medication intake, and (iii) automatic normalization of ADR mentions to MedDRA concepts.

Extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) from social media provides a promising direction to addressing this challenging task. Prior studies typically perform lexicon-based extraction using existing dictionaries or medical lexicons. While those approaches can capture ADEs and identify risky drugs from patient social media postings, they often fail to detect those ADEs whose descriptive words do not exist in medical lexicons and dictionaries. In addition, their performance is inferior when ADE related social media content is expressed in an ambiguous manner. In this research, we propose a research framework using advanced natural language processing and deep learning for high-performance ADE extraction. The framework consists of training the word embeddings using a large medical domain corpus to capture precise semantic and syntactic word relationships, and a deep learning based named entity recognition method for drug and ADE entity identification and prediction. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms existing models when extracting ADEs from social media in different test beds. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adverse drug events; Deep learning; Named entity extraction; Pharmacovigilance; Social media; Word embeddings","Decision making; Deep learning; Drug products; Extraction; Health; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Adverse drug events; Embeddings; Named entity extraction; Pharmacovigilance; Social media; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Harpaz, R., Dumouchel, W., Shah, N.H., Madigan, D., Ryan, P., Friedman, C., Novel data-mining methodologies for adverse drug event discovery and analysis (2012) Clin.

Traditionally, the evaluation of nonmedical use has focused on controlled substances with addiction risk. Currently, there is no effective means of evaluating the nonmedical use of noncontrolled antidepressants. Objective: Social listening, in the context of public health sometimes called infodemiology or infoveillance, is the process of identifying and assessing what is being said about a company, product, brand, or individual, within forms of electronic interactive media. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether content analysis of social listening data could be utilized to identify posts discussing potential misuse or nonmedical use of bupropion and two comparators, amitriptyline and venlafaxine, and (2) to describe and characterize these posts. Methods: Social listening was performed on all publicly available posts cumulative through July 29, 2015, from two harm-reduction Web forums, Bluelight and Opiophile, which mentioned the study drugs. The acquired data were stripped of personally identifiable identification (PII). A set of generic, brand, and vernacular product names was used to identify product references in posts. Posts were obtained using natural language processing tools to identify vernacular references to drug misuse-related Preferred Terms from the English Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18 terminology. Posts were reviewed manually by coders, who extracted relevant details. Results: A total of 7756 references to at least one of the study antidepressants were identified within posts gathered for this study. Of these posts, 668 (8.61%, 668/7756) referenced misuse or nonmedical use of the drug, with bupropion accounting for 438 (65.6%, 438/668). Of the 668 posts, nonmedical use was discouraged by 40.6% (178/438), 22% (22/100), and 18.5% (24/130) and encouraged by 12.3% (54/438), 10% (10/100), and 10.8% (14/130) for bupropion, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine, respectively. The most commonly reported desired effects were similar to stimulants with bupropion, sedatives with amitriptyline, and dissociatives with venlafaxine. The nasal route of administration was most frequently reported for bupropion, whereas the oral route was most frequently reported for amitriptyline and venlafaxine. Bupropion and venlafaxine were most commonly procured from health care providers, whereas amitriptyline was most commonly obtained or stolen from a third party. The Fleiss kappa for interrater agreement among 20 items with 7 categorical response options evaluated by all 11 raters was 0.448 (95% CI 0.421-0.457). Conclusions: Social listening, conducted in collaboration with harm-reduction Web forums, offers a valuable new data source that can be used for monitoring nonmedical use of antidepressants. Additional work on the capabilities of social listening will help further delineate the benefits and limitations of this rapidly evolving data source. © Laurie S Anderson, Heidi G Bell, Michael Gilbert, Julie E Davidson, Christina Winter, Monica J Barratt, Beta Win, Jeffery L Painter, Christopher Menone, Jonathan Sayegh, Nabarun Dasgupta.

Traditional channels for identifying ADRs are reliable but very slow and only produce a small amount of data. Text reviews, either on specialized web sites or in general-purpose social networks, may lead to a data source of unprecedented size, but identifying ADRs in free-form text is a challenging natural language processing problem. In this work, we propose a novel model for this problem, uniting recurrent neural architectures and conditional random fields.

In order to perform NLP in an extendable and modular fashion, the proposed platform employs the Apache Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) and semantically annotates the results through a newly developed UIMA Semantic Common Analysis Structure Consumer (SCC). The SCC output is a graph represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) based on the W3C Web Annotation Data Model (WADM) and SNOMED-CT.

As a result, it becomes a great challenge to detect the potential adverse drug reactions before and after putting drugs into the market. With the development of the Internet, health-related social networks have accumulated large amounts of users’ comments on drugs, which may contribute to detect the adverse drug reactions. To this end, we propose a novel framework to detect potential adverse drug reactions based on healthrelated social networks. In our framework, we first extract mentions of diseases and adverse drug reactions from users’ comments using conditional random fields with different levels of features, and then filter the indications of drugs and known adverse drug reactions by external biomedical resources to obtain the potential adverse drug reactions. On the basis, we propose a modified Skip-gram model to discover associated proteins of potential adverse drug reactions, which will facilitate the biomedical experts to determine the authenticity of the potential adverse reactions. Extensive experiments based on DailyStrength show that our framework is effective for detecting potential adverse drug reactions from users’ comments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","ADRs; Adverse drug reactions; Health-related social network","Health; Losses; Social networking (online); Natural language processing systems; ADRs; Adverse drug reactions; Biomedical resource; Conditional random field; Economic loss; Gram models; Large amounts; Pharmacodynamics",,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61277370, 61402075, 61572098, 61572102, 61602078, 61632011

These focused issues and in-depth reviews of several other active research areas, such as pharmacovigilance and summarization, allowed us to discuss in greater depth disease modeling and predictive analytics using clinical texts, and text analysis in social media for healthcare quality assessment, trends towards online interventions based on rapid analysis of health-related posts, and consumer health question answering, among other issues.CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that although clinical NLP continues to advance towards practical applications and more NLP methods are used in large-scale live health information applications, more needs to be done to make NLP use in clinical applications a routine widespread reality. Progress in clinical NLP is mirrored by developments in social media text analysis: the research is moving from capturing trends to addressing individual health-related posts, thus showing potential to become a tool for precision medicine and a valuable addition to the standard healthcare quality evaluation tools.","computing methodologies; medical informatics applications; Natural Language Processing; review; social media","consumer health information; drug surveillance program; electronic health record; human; medical informatics; natural language processing; phenotype; Consumer Health Information; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Informatics Applications; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Phenotype",,,,,"R01 GM114355

Based on the intuition that patients post about Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) expressing negative sentiments, we investigate the effect of sentiment analysis features in locating ADR mentions. Methods We enrich the feature space of a state-of-the-art ADR identification method with sentiment analysis features. Using a corpus of posts from the DailyStrength forum and tweets annotated for ADR and indication mentions, we evaluate the extent to which sentiment analysis features help in locating ADR mentions and distinguishing them from indication mentions. Results Evaluation results show that sentiment analysis features marginally improve ADR identification in tweets and health related forum posts. Adding sentiment analysis features achieved a statistically significant F-measure increase from 72.14% to 73.22% in the Twitter part of an existing corpus using its original train/test split. Using stratified 10 × 10-fold cross-validation, statistically significant F-measure increases were shown in the DailyStrength part of the corpus, from 79.57% to 80.14%, and in the Twitter part of the corpus, from 66.91% to 69.16%. Moreover, sentiment analysis features are shown to reduce the number of ADRs being recognized as indications. Conclusion This study shows that adding sentiment analysis features can marginally improve the performance of even a state-of-the-art ADR identification method. This improvement can be of use to pharmacovigilance practice, due to the rapidly increasing popularity of social media and health forums. © 2016 The Authors","Adverse drug reactions; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Text mining","Data mining; Health; Natural language processing systems; Sentiment analysis; Social aspects; Social networking (online); 10-fold cross-validation; Adverse drug reaction (ADRs); Adverse drug reactions; Evaluation results; Identification method; Negative sentiments; Social media; Text mining; Pharmacodynamics; adverse drug reaction; Article; data mining; drug surveillance program; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sentiment analysis; social media; statistical analysis; drug surveillance program; human; Internet; public health; social media; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Internet; Pharmacovigilance; Public Health; Social Media",,,,,"U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM: R01LM011176

Existing systems for monitoring adverse drug events, such as the Federal Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) in the US, have shown limited effectiveness due to the lack of incentives for healthcare professionals and patients. While social media present opportunities to mine information about adverse events in near real-time, there are still important questions to be answered in order to understand their impact on pharmacovigilance. First, it is not known how many relevant social media posts occur per day on platforms like Twitter, i.e., whether there is “enough signal” for a post-market pharmacovigilance program based on Twitter mining. Second, it is not known what other topics are discussed by users in posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. In this paper, we outline how social media can be used as a human sensor for drug use monitoring. We introduce a large-scale, near real-time system for computational pharmacovigilance, and use our system to estimate the order of magnitude of the volume of daily self-reported pharmaceutical drug side effect tweets. The processing pipeline comprises a set of cascaded filters, followed by a supervised machine learning classifier. The cascaded filters quickly reduce the volume to a manageable sub-stream, from which a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier identifies adverse events based on a rich set of features taking into account surface-textual properties, as well as domain knowledge about drugs, side effects and the Twitter medium. Using a dataset of 10,000 manually annotated tweets, a SVM classifier achieves F1=60.4% and AUC=0.894. The yield of the classifier for a drug universe comprising 2,600 keywords is 721 tweets per day. We also investigate what other topics are discussed in the posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. We conclude by suggesting an ecosystem where regulators and pharmaceutical companies utilize social media to obtain feedback about consequences of pharmaceutical drug use. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

With the development of Web 2.0, social media has become a large data source for information on ADEs. The objective of this study is to develop a relation extraction system that uses natural language processing techniques to effectively distinguish between ADEs and non-ADEs in informal text on social media. Methods and materials: We develop a feature-based approach that utilizes various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Information-gain-based feature selection is performed to address high-dimensional features. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of four well-known kernel-based approaches (i.e., subset tree kernel, tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and all-paths graph kernel) and several ensembles that are generated by adopting different combination methods (i.e., majority voting, weighted averaging, and stacked generalization). All of the approaches are tested using three data sets: two health-related discussion forums and one general social networking site (i.e., Twitter). Results: When investigating the contribution of each feature subset, the feature-based approach attains the best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values, which are 78.6%, 72.2%, and 79.2% on the three data sets. When individual methods are used, we attain the best AUC values of 82.1%, 73.2%, and 77.0% using the subset tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and feature-based approach on the three data sets, respectively. When using classifier ensembles, we achieve the best AUC values of 84.5%, 77.3%, and 84.5% on the three data sets, outperforming the baselines. Conclusions: Our experimental results indicate that ADE extraction from social media can benefit from feature selection. With respect to the effectiveness of different feature subsets, lexical features and semantic features can enhance the ADE extraction capability. Kernel-based approaches, which can stay away from the feature sparsity issue, are qualified to address the ADE extraction problem. Combining different individual classifiers using suitable combination methods can further enhance the ADE extraction effectiveness. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Adverse drug event extraction; Feature selection; Feature-based approach; Kernel-based approaches; Relation extraction; Social media","Classification (of information); Extraction; Forestry; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Set theory; Social networking (online); Trees (mathematics); Event extraction; Feature based approaches; Kernel based approach; Relation extraction; Social media; Feature extraction; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; adverse drug reaction; all paths graph kernel; area under the curve; Article; averaging; controlled study; data extraction; extraction; headache; human; kernel method; natural language processing; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; semantics; shortest dependency path kernel; social media; social network; data mining; drug surveillance program; Internet; Data Mining; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Internet; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Semantics; Social Media",,,,,"2015KRM021

With morepeople discussing their health information online publicly, social media platforms present a richsource of information for exploring adverse drug reactions (ADRs). ADRs are major public healthproblems that result in deaths and hospitalizations of millions of people. Unfortunately, not allADRs are identified before a drug is made available in the market. In this study, an ADR eventmonitoring system is developed which can recognize ADR mentions from a tweet and classify itsassertion. We explored several entity recognition features, feature conjunctions, and feature selectionand analyzed their characteristics and impacts on the recognition of ADRs, which have never beenstudied previously. The results demonstrate that the entity recognition performance for ADR canachieve an F-score of 0.562 on the PSB Social Media Mining shared task dataset, which outperformsthe partial-matching-based method by 0.122. After feature selection, the F-score can be furtherimproved by 0.026. This novel technique of text mining utilizing shared online social media data willopen an array of opportunities for researchers to explore various health related issues. © 2016 by the authors.","Adverse drug reactions; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Social media; Word embedding","Data mining; Digital communication systems; Health; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Text processing; Adverse drug reactions; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Social media; Word embedding; Pharmacodynamics",,,,,,,,"Lardon, J., Abdellaoui, R., Bellet, F., Asfari, H., Souvignet, J., Texier, N., Jaulent, M.C., Bousquet, C., Adverse Drug Reaction Identification and Extraction in Social Media: A Scoping Review J., , Med.

Limitations of these data sources include potential under-reporting, lack of geographic diversity, and time lag between event occurrence and discovery. There is growing interest in exploring the use of social media (‘social listening’) to supplement established approaches for pharmacovigilance. Although social listening is commonly used for commercial purposes, there are only anecdotal reports of its use in pharmacovigilance. Health information posted online by patients is often publicly available, representing an untapped source of post-marketing safety data that could supplement data from existing sources. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to describe one methodology that could help unlock the potential of social media for safety surveillance. Methods: A third-party vendor acquired 24 months of publicly available Facebook and Twitter data, then processed the data by standardizing drug names and vernacular symptoms, removing duplicates and noise, masking personally identifiable information, and adding supplemental data to facilitate the review process. The resulting dataset was analyzed for safety and benefit information. Results: In Twitter, a total of 6,441,679 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms (PTs) representing 702 individual PTs were discussed in the same post as a drug compared with 15,650,108 total PTs representing 946 individual PTs in Facebook. Further analysis revealed that 26 % of posts also contained benefit information. Conclusion: Social media listening is an important tool to augment post-marketing safety surveillance. Much work remains to determine best practices for using this rapidly evolving data source. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"codeine; dexamphetamine; diphenhydramine; glucose; ibuprofen; influenza vaccine; non prescription drug; oxycodone; paracetamol; prescription drug; zolpidem; abdominal pain; abnormal dreaming; affect; anxiety; arthralgia; Article; asthma; Bayes theorem; bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; consciousness; convulsion; coughing; death; dependent personality disorder; depression; drug abuse; drug overdose; drug surveillance program; dysesthesia; dyspnea; elevated blood pressure; falling; fatigue; fever; flu like syndrome; glucose blood level; headache; health service; heart palpitation; hemorrhoid; human; identifiable information; infection; injection site pain; injury; insomnia; Internet; liver function; lung disease; machine learning; malaise; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; medical information; medical information system; memory disorder; muscle twitch; natural language processing; pain; pallor; pneumonia; postmarketing surveillance; predictive value; pregnancy; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; restlessness; skin discomfort; social media; somnolence; stress; swelling; tremor; weight gain; weight reduction; wheezing; drug surveillance program; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; factual database; information retrieval; postmarketing surveillance; procedures; research; safety; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Databases, Factual; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pharmacovigilance; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Research Report; Safety; Social Media",,"codeine, 76-57-3; dexamphetamine, 1462-73-3, 51-63-8, 51-64-9; diphenhydramine, 147-24-0, 58-73-1; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; ibuprofen, 15687-27-1, 79261-49-7, 31121-93-4, 527688-20-6; oxycodone, 124-90-3, 76-42-6; paracetamol, 103-90-2; zolpidem, 82626-48-0",,,,,,"The importance of PV: safety monitoring of medical products.

Although, there are various pros and cons of using social media for automatic ADR monitoring, information on social media provided by patients about drugs are widely considered a valuable resource for post-marketing drug surveillance. In this study, we developed a named entity recognition (NER) system based on conditional random fields to identify ADRs-related information from Twitter data. The representation of words for the input text is one of the crucial steps in supervised learning. Recently, the word vector representation is becoming popular, which uses unlabeled data to provide a generalization for reducing the data sparsity in word representation. This study examines different word representation methods for the ADR recognition task, including token normalization, and two state-of-the-art word embedding methods, namely word2vec and the global vectors (GloVe). The experimental results demonstrate that all of the studied representation scheme can improve the recall rate and overall F-measure with the cost of the reduced precision. The manual analysis of the generated clusters demonstrates that word2vec has stronger cluster trends compared to GloVe. © 2015 IEEE.","adverse drug reactions; named entity recognition; natural language processing; social media; word embedding","Artificial intelligence; Economic and social effects; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Adverse drug reactions; Named entity recognition; NAtural language processing; Social media; word embedding; Pharmacodynamics",,,,,,,,"Vervloet, D., Durham, S., (1998) Adverse Reactions to Drugs, 316; Lazarou, J., Pomeranz, B.H., Corey, P.N., Lncidence of adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients: A meta-analysis of prospective studies (1998) JAMA, 279, pp. 1200-1205; Ahmad, S.R., Adverse drug event monitoring at the Food and Drug Administration (2003) Joumal of General Intemal Medicine, 18, pp. 57-60; Johnson, J.A., Bootman, J.L., Drug-related morbidity and mortality: A cost-of-illness model (1995) Archives of Intemal Medicine, 155, pp. 1949-1956; Unasinghe, T.M., Adverse drug reactions: Monitoring, reporting and prevention (2002) The Ceylon Medical Journal, 47, pp. 19-21; Franzen, W., Can social media benefit drug safety (2011) Drug Safety, 34, p. 793; Lardon, J., Abdellaoui, R., Bellet, F., Asfari, H., Souvignet, J., Texier, N., Adverse drug reaction identification and extraction in social media: A scoping review (2015) J Med Internet Res, 17, p. e171. , 2015107/10; Benton, A., Ungar, L., Hill, S., Hennessy, S., Mao, J., Chung, A., Identifying potential adverse effects using the web: A new approach to medical hypothesis generation (2011) Journal of Biomedical InfOlmatics, 44, pp. 989-996; Lafferty, J., McCallum, A., Pereira, F., Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data (2001) Presented at the Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML); Muneeb, T., Sahu, S.K., Anand, A., Evaluating distributed word representations for capturing semantics of biomedical concepts (2015) ACLUCNLP 2015, p. 158; Tsai, R.T.-H., Sung, C.-L., Dai, H.-J., Hung, H.-C., Sung, T.-Y., Hsu, W.-L., NERBio: Using selected word conjunctions, term normalization, and global patterns to improve biomedical named entity recognition (2006) BMC Bioinfonnatics, 7, p. 811. , Dec; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., DistTibuted representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3111-3119; Pennington, J., Socher, R., Manning, C.D., Glove: Global vectors for word representation (2014) Proceedings of the Empiricial Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2014), 12, pp. 1532-1543; Dai, H.-J., Syed-Abdul, S., Chen, C.-W., Wu, C.-C., Recognition and evaluation of clinical section headings in clinical documents using token-based foimulation with conditional random fields (2015) BioMed Research International, 2015; Eltyeb, S., Salim, N., Chemical named entities recognition: A review on approaches and applications (2014) Journal of CheminfOlmatics, 6, p. 17; Dai, H.J., Lai, P.T., Chang, Y.C., Tsai, R.T., Enhancing of chemical compound and drug name recognition using representative tag scheme and fme-grained tokenization (2015) J Cheminform, 7, p.

Expensive clinical trials do not uncover all the ADRs and also cumbersome for consumers and healthcare professionals. Majority of existing methods rely on patients' spontaneous self-reports. The recent explosion of micro blogging platforms such as Twitter presents a new information source to discover ADRs. In this study, the authors developed a system to automatically extract ADRs from Twitter messages utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. First, the authors proposed a novel method to filter out all the drug related messages from the Twitter data stream. Dictionary based approaches were used to identify medical terminology, emoticons and slang words. The interpretation of internet language was also addressed in this research. The best classifier for the classification of ADR reached an accuracy of 68% with F-measure of 69%.

In this paper, we describe a system which extracts medical entities in French drug reviews written by users. We focus on the identification of medical conditions, which is based on the concept of post-coordination: we first extract minimal medical-related entities (pain, stomach) then we combine them to identify complex ones (It was the worst [pain I ever felt in my stomach]). These two steps are respectively performed by two classifiers, the first being based on Conditional Random Fields and the second one on Support Vector Machines. The overall results of the minimal entity classifier are the following: P=0.926; R=0.849; F1=0.886. A thourough analysis of the feature set shows that, when combined with word lemmas, clusters generated by word2vec are the most valuable features. When trained on the output of the first classifier, the second classifier's performances are the following: p=0.683;r=0.956;f1=0.797. The addition of post-processing rules did not add any significant global improvement but was found to modify the precision/recall ratio.","Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance","Coordination reactions; Natural language processing systems; Classifier's performance; Conditional random field; Drug adverse effects; Medical conditions; Named entity recognition; Pharmacovigilance; Post processing; Related entities; Social networking (online)",,,,,"-2013-S-060

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring supplements and ensuring that supplements are safe. However, current surveillance protocols are not always effective. Leveraging user-generated textual data, in the form of Amazon.com reviews for nutritional supplements, we use natural language processing techniques to develop a system for the monitoring of dietary sup- plements. We use topic modeling techniques, specifically a variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and background knowledge in the form of an adverse reaction dictionary to score products based on their potential danger to the public. Our approach generates topics that semantically cap- ture adverse reactions from a document set consisting of reviews posted by users of specific products, and based on these topics, we propose a scoring mechanism to categorize products as “high potential danger”, “average potential danger” and “low potential danger.” We evaluate our system by com- paring the system categorization with human annotators, and we find that the our system agrees with the annotators 69.4% of the time. With these results, we demonstrate that our methods show promise and that our system represents a proof of concept as a viable low-cost, active approach for dietary supplement monitoring. © 2016, World Scientific Publishing Co.

The promise of social media has been realized by the public health domain, and recent research has addressed some important challenges in that domain by utilizing social media data. Tasks such as monitoring u trends, viral disease outbreaks, medication abuse, and adverse drug reactions are some examples of studies where data from social media have been exploited. The focus of this workshop is to explore solutions to three important natural language processing challenges for domain-specific social media text: (i) text classification, (ii) information extraction, and (iii) concept normalization. To explore different approaches to solving these problems on social media data, we designed a shared task which was open to participants globally. We designed three tasks using our in-house annotated Twitter data on adverse drug reactions. Task 1 involved automatic classification of adverse drug reaction assertive user posts; Task 2 focused on extracting specific adverse drug reaction mentions from user posts; and Task 3, which was slightly ill-defined due to the complex nature of the problem, involved normalizing user mentions of adverse drug reactions to standardized concept IDs. A total of 11 teams participated, and a total of 24 (18 for Task 1, and 6 for Task 2) system runs were submitted. Following the evaluation of the systems, and an assessment of their innovation/novelty, we accepted 7 descriptive manuscripts for publication - 5 for Task 1 and 2 for Task 2. We provide descriptions of the tasks, data, and participating systems in this paper. © 2016, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte Ltd.

Objectives Our objective was to compare electronic health record data and social media data to better understand differences and similarities between clinician-reported ADRs and patients’ concerns regarding aspirin and atorvastatin. Methods This pilot study explored a large repository of electronic health record data and social media data for clinician-reported ADRs and patients concerns for two common medications: aspirin (n = 31,817 ADRs accessible in clinical data; n = 19,186 potential ADRs accessible in social media data) and atorvastatin (n = 15,047 ADRs accessible in clinical data; n = 23,408 potential ADRs accessible in social media data). Results We found that the most frequently reported ADRs matched the most frequent patients’ concerns. However, several less frequently reported reactions were more prevalent on social media (i.e., aspirin-induced hypoglycemia was discussed only on social media). Overall, we found a relatively strong positive and statistically significant correlation between the frequency ranking of reactions and patients’ concerns for atorvastatin (Pearson’s r = 0.61, p<0.001) but not for aspirin (Pearson’s r = 0.1, p = 0.69). Conclusion Future studies should develop further natural language methods for a more detailed data analysis (i.e., identifying causality and temporal aspects in the social media data). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; atorvastatin; acetylsalicylic acid; atorvastatin; adverse drug reaction; Alzheimer disease; amnesia; anaphylaxis; anemia; angioneurotic edema; arthritis; Article; asthma; bleeding; bronchospasm; clinical study; comparative study; coughing; depression; diarrhea; dyspnea; electronic health record; epistaxis; fatigue; fever; food and drug administration; gastrointestinal symptom; hair loss; headache; heart arrhythmia; human; hypoglycemia; hypotension; liver toxicity; medical information; medical ontology; mental health; muscle cramp; musculoskeletal pain; myositis; natural language processing; nausea; nephrotoxicity; personal experience; pilot study; priority journal; pruritus; rash; Reye syndrome; seizure; social media; swelling; thrombocytopenia; tinnitus; urticaria; vomiting; weakness; wheezing; chemically induced; drug surveillance program; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; electronic health record; Exanthema; musculoskeletal pain; physician attitude; social media; statistics and numerical data; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aspirin; Atorvastatin Calcium; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Electronic Health Records; Exanthema; Humans; Musculoskeletal Pain; Physician's Role; Pilot Projects; Social Media",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; atorvastatin, 134523-00-5, 134523-03-8; Aspirin; Atorvastatin Calcium",,,"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ: 1R01HS022728-01","This study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Grant #1R01HS022728-01.",,"Kongkaew, C., Noyce, P.R., Ashcroft, D.M., Hospital admissions associated with adverse drug reactions: A systematic review of prospective observational studies (2008) Ann Pharmacother, 42 (7), pp. 1017-1025; Ahmad, S.R., Adverse drug event monitoring at the Food and Drug Administration (2003) J Gen Intern Med, 18 (1), pp. 57-60; Pharmacovigilance, , http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/safety_efficacy/pharmvigi/en/; (2001) Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21St Century, , Washington, DC:NationalAcademy Press; Rozenblum, R., Bates, D.W., Patient-centred healthcare, social media and the internet: The perfect storm?

Efficient strategies for the extraction of information about ADRs from free text sources are essential to support the important task of detecting and classifying unexpected pathologies, possibly related to (therapy-related) drug use. Narrative ADR descriptions may be collected in different ways, e.g., Either by monitoring social networks or through the so called 'spontaneous reporting, the main method pharmacovigilance adopts in order to identify ADRs. The encoding of free-text ADR descriptions according to MedDRA standard terminology is central for report analysis. It is a complex work, which has to be manually implemented by the pharmacovigilance experts. The manual encoding is expensive (in terms of time). Moreover, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur, since the number of reports is growing up day by day. In this paper, we propose Magi Coder, an efficient Natural Language Processing algorithm able to automatically derive MedDRA terminologies from free text ADR descriptions. Magi Coder is part of Vigi Work, a web application for online ADR reporting and analysis. From a practical point of view, Magi Coder reduces the encoding time of ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the MedDRA terms proposed by Magi Coder, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70K terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality of the following data analysis. Our proposal is based on a general approach, not depending on the considered language. Indeed, we developed Magi Coder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but preliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary changes. © 2015 IEEE.","Adverse reaction entry; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computational linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Health care; Information analysis; Information science; Natural language processing systems; Quality control; Terminology; Adverse drug reaction (ADRs); Adverse drug reactions; Adverse reaction entry; Efficient strategy; Extraction of information; NAtural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; WEB application; Pharmacodynamics",,,,,,,,"Arthur, N., Bentsi-Enchill, A., Couper, R., (2002) The Importance of Pharmacovigilance - Safety Monitoring of Medicinal Products, , World Health Organization; Borg, J., Aislaitner, G., Pirozynski, M., Mifsud, S., Strengthening and rationalizing pharmacovigilance in the EU: Where is Europe heading to?

Patient reports of adverse drug events from social media have great potential to improve current practice of pharmacovigilance. However, extracting patient adverse drug event reports from social media continues to be an important challenge for health informatics research. In this study, we develop a research framework with advanced natural language processing techniques for integrated and high-performance patient reported adverse drug event extraction. The framework consists of medical entity extraction for recognizing patient discussions of drug and events, adverse drug event extraction with shortest dependency path kernel based statistical learning method and semantic filtering with information from medical knowledge bases, and report source classification to tease out noise. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments were conducted on a test bed encompassing about postings from major diabetes and heart disease forums in the United States. The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes to its verall effectiveness. Our framework significantly outperforms prior work. © 2015.","Adverse drug event extraction; Health social media analytics; Information search and retrieval; Knowledge acquisition; Pharmacovigilance; Text mining","Classification (of information); Extraction; Health; Information analysis; Information filtering; Information retrieval; Knowledge acquisition; Medical problems; Natural language processing systems; Patient treatment; Semantics; Social networking (online); Event extraction; Information search and retrieval; Pharmacovigilance; Social media analytics; Text mining; Data mining; Article; classification; data extraction; data mining; data processing; diabetes mellitus; drug safety; drug surveillance program; heart disease; language processing; machine learning; medical research; priority journal; semantics; social media; statistical model; United States; human; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Humans; Pharmacovigilance; Semantics; Social Media",,,,,"IIP-1417181","This material is based upon work supported by a subcontract from Caduceus Intelligence Corporation with grant funds provided by the United States National Science Foundation ( IIP-1417181 ).",,"Miller, A.R., Tucker, C., Active social media management: the case of health care (2013) Inform.

In this paper we propose using the popular micro-blogging service Twitter to gather evidence about adverse drug reactions (ADRs) after firstly having identified micro-blog messages (also know as ""tweets"") that report first-hand experience. In order to achieve this goal we explore machine learning with data crowdsourced from laymen annotators. With the help of lay annotators recruited from CrowdFlower we manually annotated 1548 tweets containing keywords related to two kinds of drugs: SSRIs (eg. Paroxetine), and cognitive enhancers (eg. Ritalin). Our results show that inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' kappa) for crowdsourcing ranks in moderate agreement with a pair of experienced annotators (Spearman's Rho. =. 0.471). We utilized the gold standard annotations from CrowdFlower for automatically training a range of supervised machine learning models to recognize first-hand experience. F-Score values are reported for 6 of these techniques with the Bayesian Generalized Linear Model being the best (. F-Score. =. 0.64 and Informedness. =. 0.43) when combined with a selected set of features obtained by using information gain criteria. © 2015.","Crowdsourcing; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Hospital data processing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Supervised learning; Adverse drug reaction (ADRs); Crowdsourcing; Generalized linear model; Micro-blogging services; NAtural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Supervised machine learning; Twitter; Social networking (online); adverse outcome; Article; Bayes theorem; computer interface; computer language; computer model; crowdsourcing; drug use; human computer interaction; machine learning; mathematical model; online system; prescription; priority journal; social media; human; Crowdsourcing; Drug Prescriptions; Humans; Social Media",,,,,"U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM: R00LM011393

Outside traditional surveys, little is known about the opioid-induced constipation (OIC) patient experience and its impact on pain management. The purpose of this study was to use data from social media platforms to qualitatively examine patient beliefs about OIC and other prominent GI side effects, their impact on effective pain management and doctor-patient interaction. The authors collected Tweets from March 25 to July 31, 2014, and e-forum posts from health-related social networking sites regardless of timestamp. The authors identified specific keywords related to opioids and GI side effects to locate relevant content in the dataset, which was then manually coded using ATLAS.ti software. The authors examined 2,519,868 Tweets and more than 1.8 billion e-forum posts, of which, 88,586 Tweets and 9,767 posts satisfied the search criteria. Three thousand three individuals experienced opioidinduced GI side effects, mostly related to phenanthrenes (n = 1,589), and 1,274 (42.4 percent) individuals described constipation. Over-the-counter medications and nonevidence-based natural approaches were most commonly used to alleviate constipation. Many individuals questioned, rotated, reduced, or stopped their opioid treatments as a result of their GI side effects. Investigation of social media reveals a struggle to balance pain management with opioid-induced GI side effects, especially constipation. Individuals are often unprepared to treat OIC, to modify opioid regiments without medical advice, and to resort to using natural remedies and treatments lacking scientific evidence of effectiveness. These results identify opportunities to improve physician-patient communication and explore effective treatment alternatives. © 2015 Journal of Opioid Management, All Rights Reserved.","Doctor-patient communication;

Major drug agencies have devoted a great interest in the early detection of ADRs due to their high incidence and increasing health care costs. Reporting systems are available in order for both healthcare professionals and patients to alert about possible ADRs. However, several studies have shown that these adverse events are underestimated. Our hypothesis is that health social networks could be a significant information source for the early detection of ADRs as well as of new drug indications. Methods: In this work we present a system for detecting drug effects (which include both adverse drug reactions as well as drug indications) from user posts extracted from a Spanish health forum. Texts were processed using MeaningCloud, a multilingual text analysis engine, to identify drugs and effects. In addition, we developed the first Spanish database storing drugs as well as their effects automatically built from drug package inserts gathered from online websites. We then applied a distant-supervision method using the database on a collection of 84,000 messages in order to extract the relations between drugs and their effects. To classify the relation instances, we used a kernel method based only on shallow linguistic information of the sentences. Results: Regarding Relation Extraction of drugs and their effects, the distant supervision approach achieved a recall of 0.59 and a precision of 0.48. Conclusions: The task of extracting relations between drugs and their effects from social media is a complex challenge due to the characteristics of social media texts. These texts, typically posts or tweets, usually contain many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Moreover, patients use lay terminology to refer to diseases, symptoms and indications that is not usually included in lexical resources in languages other than English. © 2015 Segura-Bedmar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adverse drug reaction; data mining; drug surveillance program; human; information dissemination; Internet; language; machine learning; natural language processing; procedures; social media; Data Mining; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Information Dissemination; Internet; Language; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 287863",,,"Wester, K., Jönsson, A.K., Spigset, O., Druid, H., Staffan, H., Incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions: A population based study (2008) Brit J Clin Pharmaco, 65 (4), pp. 573-579; Bond, C.A., Raehl, C.L., Adverse drug reactions in United States hospitals (2006) Pharmacotherapy, 26 (5), pp. 601-608; Van Der Hooft, C.S., Sturkenboom, M.C.J.M., Van Grootheest, K., Kingma, H.J., Stricker, B., Adverse drug reaction-related hospitalisations (2006) Drug Saf, 29 (2), pp. 161-168; Bates, D.W., Evans, R.C., Murff, H., Stetson, P.D., Pizziferri, L., Hripcsak, G., Detecting adverse events using information technology (2003) J Am Med Inform Assoc, 10 (2), pp. 115-128; McClellan, M., Drug Safety Reform at the FDA-Pendulum Swing or Systematic Improvement?

However, in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions, the ability to recognise when laymen's terms refer to a particular medical concept (i.e. text normalisation) is required. To achieve this, we propose to adapt an existing phrase-based machine translation (MT) technique and a vector representation of words to map between a social media phrase and a medical concept. We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to adverse drug reactions. Our experimental results show that the combination of a phrase-based MT technique and the similarity between word vector representations outperforms the baselines that apply only either of them by up to 55%. © 2015 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Character recognition; Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Encoding (symbols); Health; Natural language processing systems; Pharmacodynamics; Adverse drug reactions; Health condition; Infectious disease; Medical concepts; Medical terms; Phrase-based machine translations; Text Normalisation; Vector representations; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"Baldwin, T., Cook, P., Lui, M., MacKinlay, A., Wang, L., How noisy social media text, how diffrnt social media sources (2013) Proceedings of the Sixth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing, pp. 356-364; Craswell, N., Mean reciprocal rank (2009) Encyclopedia of Database Systems, p. 1703. , Springer; Elkin, P.L., Froehling, D.A., Wahner-Roedler, D.L., Brown, S.H., Bailey, K.R., Comparison of natural language processing biosurveillance methods for identifying influenza from encounter notes (2012) Annals of Internal Medicine, 156 (1), pp. 11-18; Gobbel, G.T., Reeves, R., Jayaramaraja, S., Giuse, D., Speroff, T., Brown, S.H., Elkin, P.L., Matheny, M.E., Development and evaluation of raptat: A machine learning system for concept mapping of phrases from medical narratives (2014) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 48, pp. 54-65; Hanson, C.L., Burton, S.H., Giraud-Carrier, C., West, J.H., Barnes, M.D., Hansen, B., Tweaking and tweeting: Exploring twitter for nonmedical use of a psychostimulant drug (adderall) among college students (2013) Journal of Medical Internet Research, 15 (4); Koehn, P., Josef Och, F., Marcu, D., Statistical phrase-based translation (2003) Proceedings of the 2003 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics on Human Language Technology, 1, pp. 48-54. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Koehn, P., Hoang, H., Birch, A., Callison-Burch, C., Federico, M., Bertoldi, N., Cowan, B., Zens, R., Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation (2007) Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the ACL on Interactive Poster and Demonstration Sessions, pp. 177-180. , Association for Computational Linguistics; Limsopatham, N., Collier, N., Towards the semantic interpretation of personal health messages from social media (2015) Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Understanding the City with Urban Informatics (UCUI 2015) in Conjunction with CIKM 2015, , https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/249275, in press; Mikolov, T., Le, Q.V., Sutskever, I., (2013) Exploiting Similarities Among Languages for Machine Translation, , arXiv preprint arXiv. 1309.4168; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 3111-3119; Morgan, A.A., Lu, Z., Wang, X., Cohen, A.M., Fluck, J., Ruch, P., Divoli, A., Hakenberg, J., Overview of biocreative II gene normalization (2008) Genome Biology, 9, p.

Accurate detection of entities such as diseases, drugs, and symptoms could be used for biosurveillance (e.g. monitoring of flu) and identification of adverse drug events. However, a critical assessment of performance of current text mining technology on Twitter has not been done yet in the medical domain. Here, we study the development of a Twitter data set annotated with relevant medical entities which we have publicly released. The manual annotation results show that it is possible to perform high-quality annotation despite of the complexity of medical terminology and the lack of context in a tweet. Furthermore, we have evaluated the capability of state-of-the-art approaches to reproduce the annotations in the data set. The best methods achieve F-scores of 55-66%. The data analysis and the preliminary results provide valuable insights on identifying medical entities in Twitter for various applications. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.","data set generation; medical entity recognition; Social media","Bioinformatics; Data mining; Health; Terminology; Adverse drug events; Critical assessment; Data set; Entity recognition; Health related informations; Medical terminologies; Social media; State-of-the-art approach; Social networking (online); drug; classification; controlled vocabulary; data mining; diseases; health survey; natural language processing; nomenclature; procedures; social media; symptom assessment; Data Mining; Disease; Natural Language Processing; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Population Surveillance; Social Media; Symptom Assessment; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled",,"Pharmaceutical Preparations",,,,,,"Espino, J.U., Wagner, M.M., Tsui, F.C., The RODS open source project: Removing a barrier to syndromic surveillance (2004) Medinfo, pp. 1192-1196; Collier, N., BioCaster: Detecting public health rumors with a Web-based text mining system (2008) Bioinformatics, 24 (24), pp. 2940-2941; Ginsberg, J., Mohebbi, M.H., Patel, R.S., Detecting influenza epidemics using search engine query data (2008) Nature, 457 (7232), pp. 1012-1014; Segura-Bedmar, I., De La Pena, S., Martínez, P., Extracting drug indications and adverse drug reactions from Spanish health social media (2014) ACL, p. 98; Metke-Jimenez, A., Karimi, S., Paris, C., Evaluation of text-processing algorithms for adverse drug event extraction from social media (2014) Proceedings of the First International Workshop on Social Media Retrieval and Analysis.

Annotations contain mentions of concepts such as drugs, adverse effects, symptoms, and diseases linked to their corresponding concepts in controlled vocabularies, i.e., SNOMED Clinical Terms and MedDRA. The quality of the annotations is ensured by annotation guidelines, multi-stage annotations, measuring inter-annotator agreement, and final review of the annotations by a clinical terminologist.

This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and userexpressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. Methods: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. Results: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. Conclusion: It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, usergenerated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets. © The Author 2015.","ADR; Adverse drug reaction; Deep learning word embeddings; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social media mining","acetylsalicylic acid; amphetamine plus dexamphetamine; aripiprazole; citalopram; lorazepam; paroxetine; quetiapine; venlafaxine; zolpidem tartrate; Article; data mining; drug surveillance program; hangover; headache; heartburn; human; machine learning; natural language processing; rash; semantics; social media; taste disorder; tremor; urticaria; artificial intelligence; data mining; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Data Mining; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Semantics; Social Media",,"acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; aripiprazole, 129722-12-9; citalopram, 59729-33-8; lorazepam, 846-49-1; paroxetine, 61869-08-7; quetiapine, 111974-72-2; venlafaxine, 93413-69-5, 99300-78-4; zolpidem tartrate, 99294-93-6","abilify; adderall; ambien; aspirin; ativan; effexor; paxil; seroquel",,"National Institutes of Health, NIH

Current research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social media-where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP) approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the task of ADR detection from user posted internet data; and (iii) to investigate if combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic classification accuracies. Methods: One of our three data sets contains annotated sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house, consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties (. e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly, using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora in attempts to boost classification accuracies. Results: Our feature-rich classification approach performs significantly better than previously published approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770), 0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units) respectively. Conclusions: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification performance. This form of multi-corpus training may be particularly useful in cases where data sets are heavily imbalanced (. e.g., social media data), and may reduce the time and costs associated with the annotation of data in the future. © 2014 The Authors.","Adverse drug reaction;

It is emerging as a tool to leverage underutilized data sources that can improve pharmacovigilance, including the objective of adverse drug event (ADE) detection and assessment. This article provides an overview of recent advances in pharmacovigilance driven by the application of text mining, and discusses several data sources—such as biomedical literature, clinical narratives, product labeling, social media, and Web search logs—that are amenable to text mining for pharmacovigilance. Given the state of the art, it appears text mining can be applied to extract useful ADE-related information from multiple textual sources. Nonetheless, further research is required to address remaining technical challenges associated with the text mining methodologies, and to conclusively determine the relative contribution of each textual source to improving pharmacovigilance. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,"adverse drug reaction; Article; biomedicine; drug surveillance program; information processing; machine learning; natural language processing; packaging; priority journal; social media; text mining; data mining; drug labeling; drug surveillance program; factual database; human; Internet; procedures; publication; Data Collection; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Drug Labeling; Humans; Internet; Periodicals as Topic; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media",,,,,"GM101430-01A1

The massive number of patient encounters results in high amounts of stored data. Transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the goal of biomedical informatics professionals for many decades, and this work is now increasingly recognized outside our field. In reviewing the literature for the past three years, we focus on ""big data"" in the context of EHR systems and we report on some examples of how secondary use of data has been put into practice.METHODS: We searched PubMed database for articles from January 1, 2011 to November 1, 2013. We initiated the search with keywords related to ""big data"" and EHR. We identified relevant articles and additional keywords from the retrieved articles were added. Based on the new keywords, more articles were retrieved and we manually narrowed down the set utilizing predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.RESULTS: Our final review includes articles categorized into the themes of data mining (pharmacovigilance, phenotyping, natural language processing), data application and integration (clinical decision support, personal monitoring, social media), and privacy and security.CONCLUSION: The increasing adoption of EHR systems worldwide makes it possible to capture large amounts of clinical data. There is an increasing number of articles addressing the theme of ""big data"", and the concepts associated with these articles vary. The next step is to transform healthcare big data into actionable knowledge.","data mining; Electronic health records; natural language processing; privacy; quality improvement; security","biology; clinical decision support system; data mining; drug surveillance program; electronic health record; electronic medical record system; natural language processing; social media; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Electronic Health Records; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Natural Language Processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social Media",,,,,"D43 TW007015, T15 LM011271, U54 HL108460, UL1TR0001000

Although the current process of pharmacovigilance is very systematic, the increasing amount of information available in specialized health-related websites as well as the exponential growth in medical literature presents a unique opportunity to supplement traditional adverse event gathering mechanisms with new-age ones. Method. We present a semi-automated pipeline to extract associations between drugs and side effects from traditional structured adverse event databases, enhanced by potential drug-adverse event pairs mined from user-comments from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The pipeline was tested using a set of 12 drugs representative of two previous studies of adverse event extraction from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. Results: Testing the pipeline shows that mining non-traditional sources helps substantiate the adverse event databases. The non-traditional sources not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest some unreported AEs for drugs which can then be analyzed further.

Aims and Scope •Includes Text Mining and Natural Language Processing Methods for extracting information from electronic health records and biomedical literature. •Analyzes text analytic tools for new media such as online forums, social media posts, tweets and video sharing. •Demonstrates how to use speech and audio technologies for improving access to online content for the visually impaired. Text Mining of Web-Based Medical Content examines various approaches to deriving high quality information from online biomedical literature, electronic health records, query search terms, social media posts and tweets. Using some of the latest empirical methods of knowledge extraction, the authors show how online content, generated by both professionals and laypersons, can be mined for valuable information about disease processes, adverse drug reactions not captured during clinical trials, and tropical fever outbreaks. Additionally, the authors show how to perform infromation extraction on a hospital intranet, how to build a social media search engine to glean information about patients' own experiences interacting with healthcare professionals, and how to improve access to online health information. This volume provides a wealth of timely material for health informatic professionals and machine learning, data mining, and natural language researchers. Topics in this book include: •Mining Biomedical Literature and Clinical Narratives •Medication Information Extraction •Machine Learning Techniques for Mining Medical Search Queries •Detecting the Level of Personal Health Information Revealed in Social Media •Curating Layperson’s Personal Experiences with Health Care from Social Media and Twitter •Health Dialogue Systems for Improving Access to Online Content •Crowd-based Audio Clips to Improve Online Video Access for the Visually Impaired •Semantic-based Visual Information Retrieval for Mining Radiographic Image Data •Evaluating the Importance of Medical Terminology in YouTube Video Titles and Descriptions. © 2014 Walter de Gruyter Inc., Boston/Berlin.",,,,,,,,,,,"Neustein, A.800 Palisade Avenue, Suite 1809, United States; email: amy.neustein@verizon.net",,,"Walter de Gruyter GmbH",,,,,,9781614513902; 9781614515418,,,"English","Text Min. of Web-Based Med.

To identify these potential drug safety issues early, surveillance must be conducted for each drug throughout its life cycle, from drug development to different phases of clinical trials, and continued after market approval. A major aim of pharmacovigilance is to identify the potential drug-event associations that may be novel in nature, severity, and/or frequency. Currently, the state-of-the-art approach for signal detection is through automated procedures by analyzing vast quantities of data for clinical knowledge. There exists a variety of resources for the task, and many of them are textual data that require text analytics and natural language processing to derive high-quality information. This chapter focuses on the utilization of text mining techniques in identifying potential safety issues of drugs from textual sources such as biomedical literature, consumer posts in social media, and narrative electronic medical records. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Adverse drug reaction; Biomedical literature mining; Data mining; Drug safety surveillance; Drug-drug interactions; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Text mining","Article; automation; classifier; data analysis; data extraction; data mining; drug nomenclature; drug safety; drug surveillance program; electronic medical record; human; information processing; machine learning; medical literature; natural language processing; priority journal; signal detection; social media; animal; bibliographic database; clinical trial (topic); data mining; electronic medical record; procedures; social media; cosmetic; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Cosmetics; Data Mining; Databases, Bibliographic; Humans; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Social Media",,"Cosmetics",,,"2011 M500669",,,"International drug monitoring: The role of the hospital (1966) Technical Report Series No. 425.

Brasil 4365, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","At the post-marketing phase when drugs are used by large populations and for long periods, unexpected adverse events may occur altering the risk-benefit relation of drugs, sometimes requiring a regulatory action. These events at the post-marketing phase require a significant increase in health care since they result in unnecessary damage, often fatal, to patients. Therefore, the early discovery of adverse events in the post-marketing phase is a primary goal of the health system, in particular for pharmacovigilance systems. The main purpose of this paper is to prove that Twitter can be used as a source to find new and already known adverse drug events. This proposal has a prominent social relevance, as it will help pharmacovigilance systems.

In the meantime, increasing numbers of patients have turned to social media to share their experiences with drugs, medical devices, and vaccines. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of concordance between Twitter posts mentioning AE-like reactions and spontaneous reports received by a regulatory agency. Methods: We collected public English-language Twitter posts mentioning 23 medical products from 1 November 2012 through 31 May 2013. Data were filtered using a semi-automated process to identify posts with resemblance to AEs (Proto-AEs). A dictionary was developed to translate Internet vernacular to a standardized regulatory ontology for analysis (MedDRA®). Aggregated frequency of identified product-event pairs was then compared with data from the public FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) by System Organ Class (SOC). Of the 6.9 million Twitter posts collected, 4,401 Proto-AEs were identified out of 60,000 examined. Automated, dictionary-based symptom classification had 72 % recall and 86 % precision. Similar overall distribution profiles were observed, with Spearman rank correlation rho of 0.75 (p < 0.0001) between Proto-AEs reported in Twitter and FAERS by SOC. Conclusion: Patients reporting AEs on Twitter showed a range of sophistication when describing their experience. Despite the public availability of these data, their appropriate role in pharmacovigilance has not been established. Additional work is needed to improve data acquisition and automation. © 2014 The Author(s).",,"adalimumab; alprazolam; citalopram; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; duloxetine; gabapentin; hepatitis B vaccine; ibuprofen; influenza vaccine; isotretinoin; lamotrigine; levonorgestrel; metformin; methotrexate; naproxen; oxycodone; paracetamol; paroxetine; prednisone; pregabalin; sertraline; tramadol; varenicline; venlafaxine; warfarin; Wart virus vaccine; zolpidem; non prescription drug; prescription drug; article; disease classification; disease severity; drug industry; drug safety; drug surveillance program; fatigue; food and drug administration; human; injection site pain; injection site urticaria; malaise; Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; natural language processing; priority journal; purpura; self report; social media; unspecified side effect; adverse drug reaction; Internet; United States; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Internet; Nonprescription Drugs; Pharmacovigilance; Prescription Drugs; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",,"adalimumab, 331731-18-1, 1446410-95-2; alprazolam, 28981-97-7; citalopram, 59729-33-8; duloxetine, 116539-59-4, 136434-34-9; gabapentin, 60142-96-3; ibuprofen, 15687-27-1, 79261-49-7, 31121-93-4, 527688-20-6; isotretinoin, 4759-48-2; lamotrigine, 84057-84-1; levonorgestrel, 797-63-7; metformin, 1115-70-4, 657-24-9; methotrexate, 15475-56-6, 59-05-2, 7413-34-5; naproxen, 22204-53-1, 26159-34-2; oxycodone, 124-90-3, 76-42-6; paracetamol, 103-90-2; paroxetine, 61869-08-7; prednisone, 53-03-2; pregabalin, 148553-50-8; sertraline, 79617-96-2; tramadol, 27203-92-5, 36282-47-0; varenicline, 249296-44-4, 375815-87-5; venlafaxine, 93413-69-5, 99300-78-4; warfarin, 129-06-6, 2610-86-8, 3324-63-8, 5543-58-8, 81-81-2; zolpidem, 82626-48-0; Nonprescription Drugs; Prescription Drugs",,,,"Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge our collaborators at the FDA, including Jesse Goodman, who was at the Office of the Chief Scientist at the time of writing, and Mark Wal-derhaug and Taxiarchis Botsis at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, for their guidance and expertise.

For surveillance of adverse drug events, patients have gradually become involved in reporting their experiences with medications through the use of dedicated and structured systems. The emerging of social networking provides a way for patients to describe their drug experiences online in less-structured free text format. We developed a computational approach that collects, processes and analyzes Twitter data for drug effects. Our approach uses a machine-learning- based classifier to classify personal experience tweets, and use NLM's MetaMap software to recognize and extract word phrases that belong to drug effects. Our results on 5 medications demonstrate the validity of our approach, and its ability to correctly extract potential drug effects from the Twitter data. It is conceivable that social media data can serve to complement and/or supplement traditional time-consuming and costly surveillance methods. © Springer-Verlag 2013.","Big data; Drug effect identification; Natural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social media mining; Twitter","Big datum; Drug effects; NAtural language processing; Pharmacovigilance; Social media minings; Twitter; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,"(2004) Pharmacovigilance: Ensuring the Safe Use of Medicines, , World Health Organization.

Early detection of adverse events benefits not only the drug regulators, but also the manufacturers for pharmacovigilance. Existing methods rely on patients' ""spontaneous"" self-reports that attest problems. The increasing popularity of social media platforms like the Twitter presents us a new information source for finding potential adverse events. Given the high frequency of user updates, mining Twitter messages can lead us to real-time pharmacovigilance. In this paper, we describe an approach to find drug users and potential adverse events by analyzing the content of twitter messages utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and to build Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Due to the size nature of the dataset (i.e., 2 billion Tweets), the experiments were conducted on a High Performance Computing (HPC) platform using MapReduce, which exhibits the trend of big data analytics. The results suggest that daily-life social networking data could help early detection of important patient safety issues.

This way of exchange of opinions and experiences has provided a rich source of information about drugs and their effectiveness and more importantly, their possible adverse reactions. We developed a system to automatically extract mentions of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from user reviews about drugs in social network websites by mining a set of language patterns. The system applied association rule mining on a set of annotated comments to extract the underlying patterns of colloquial expressions about adverse effects. The patterns were tested on a set of unseen comments to evaluate their performance. We reached to precision of 70.01% and recall of 66.32% and F-measure of 67.96%.",,"algorithm; article; automated pattern recognition; data mining; drug toxicity; human; methodology; natural language processing; Algorithms; Data Mining; Drug Toxicity; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated",,,,,,,,,"Nikfarjam, A.",,,,,,,,1942597X,,,"22195162","English","AMIA Annu Symp Proc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874210162
