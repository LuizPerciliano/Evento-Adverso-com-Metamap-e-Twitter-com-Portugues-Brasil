This paper proposes a way out of this dilemma, by showing that QM as it is formulated in standard textbooks allows for a much more substantive ontological commitment than is usually acknowledged. For this purpose, I defend a non-fundamentalist approach to ontology, which is then applied to various aspects of QM. In particular, I will defend realism about spin, which has been viewed as a particularly hard case for the ontology of QM. © 2021, The Author(s).","Effective realism; Ontology; Quantum mechanics; Spin; Underdetermination",,,,,,"Universität Bern, UB

More specifically, we elaborate on semantic web-enabled middleware, frameworks and architectures (e.g. semantic descriptors for M2M) proposed to overcome the limitations of device and data heterogeneity. We present recent advances in structuring, modelling (e.g. RDFa, JSON-LD) and semantically enriching data and information derived from sensor environments, focusing on the advanced conceptual modelling capabilities offered by semantic web ontology languages (e.g. RDF/OWL2). Querying and validation solutions on top of RDF graphs and Linked Data (e.g. SPARQL, SPIN and SHACL) are also presented. Furthermore, insights are provided on reasoning, aggregation, fusion and interpretation solutions that aim to intelligently process and ingest sensor information, infusing also human awareness for advanced situational awareness. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,"Swetina, J., Lu, G., Jacobs, P., Ennesser, F., Song, J., Toward a standardized common M2M service layer platform: Introduction to oneM2M (2014) IEEE Wirel.

Whilst Clinical Guidelines (CGs) focus on the correct prescription of antibiotics in a narrative form, Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) operationalize the knowledge contained in CGs in the form of rules at the point of care. Despite the efforts made to computerize CGs, there is still a gap between CGs and the myriad of rule technologies (based on different logic formalisms) that are available to implement CDSSs in real clinical settings. Objective: To helpCDSS designers to determine the most suitable rule-based technology (medical-oriented rules, production rules and semantic web rules) with which to model knowledge from CGs for the prescription of antibiotics. We propose a framework of criteria for this purpose that is extensible to more generic CGs. Materials and methods: Our proposal is based on the identification of core technical requirements extracted from both literature and the analysis of CGs for antibiotics, establishing three dimensions for analysis: language expressivity, interoperability and industrial aspects. We present a case study regarding the John Hopkins Hospital (JHH) Antibiotic Guidelines for Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), a highly recurring hospital acquired infection. We have adopted our framework of criteria in order to analyse and implement these CGs using various rule technologies: HL7 Arden Syntax, general-purpose Production Rules System (Drools), HL7 standard Rule Interchange Format (RIF), Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) and SParql Inference Notation (SPIN) rule extensions (implementing our own ontology for UTI). Results: We have identified the main criteria required to attain a maintainable and cost-affordable computable knowledge representation for CGs. We have represented the JHH UTI CGs knowledge in a total of 12 Arden Syntax MLMs, 81 Drools rules and 154 ontology classes, properties and individuals. Our experiments confirm the relevance of the proposed set of criteria and show the level of compliance of the different rule technologies with the JHH UTI CGs knowledge representation. Conclusions: The proposed framework of criteria may help clinical institutions to select the most suitable rule technology for the representation of CGs in general, and for the antibiotic prescription domain in particular, depicting the main aspects that lead to Computer Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs), such as Logic expressivity (Open/Closed World Assumption, Negation-As-Failure), Temporal Reasoning and Interoperability with existing HIS and clinical workflow. Future work will focus on providing clinicians with suggestions regarding new potential steps for CGs, considering process mining approaches and CGs Process Workflows, the use of HL7 FHIR for HIS interoperability and the representation of Knowledge-as- a-Service (KaaS). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arden; CDSS; CG; Drools; FHIR; HIS; KaaS; Ontology; OWL; RIF: SWRL; Rules; Semantic Web; SHACL; SPIN","Antibiotics; Computer circuits; Diseases; Hospitals; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Medical education; Ontology; Semantic Web; Syntactics; Arden; CDSS; Drools; FHIR; KaaS; RIF: SWRL; Rules; SHACL; SPIN; Decision support systems; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; cause of death; clinical decision support system; hospital infection; ontology; practice guideline; prescription; priority journal; Review; semantic web; urinary tract infection; antimicrobial stewardship; clinical decision support system; cross infection; expert system; health services research; human; organization and management; practice guideline; urinary tract infection; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Stewardship; Cross Infection; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Expert Systems; Humans; Organizational Case Studies; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Urinary Tract Infections",,"Anti-Bacterial Agents",,,"Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU

Being supported by ontology editors, rule engines and ontology reasoners, it has become a very popular choice for developing rule-based applications on top of ontologies. However, SWRL is probably not going to become a WWW Consortium standard, prohibiting industrial acceptance. On the other hand, SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) has become a de-facto industry standard to represent SPARQL rules and constraints on semantic web models, building on the widespread acceptance of SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language). In this article, we argue that the life of existing SWRL rule-based ontology applications can be prolonged by converting them to SPIN. To this end, we have developed the SWRL2SPIN tool in Prolog that transforms SWRL rules into SPIN rules, considering the object-orientation of SPIN, i.e. linking rules to the appropriate ontology classes and optimizing them, as derived by analysing the rule conditions.

There is a need for different software to communicate with one another in order to achieve its task. Therefore, a standard protocol is required. In agent technology, this common protocol is referred to as agent communication language. Agent communication language is a high-level protocol/language that allows agent applications to exchange, parse and understand the meaning of the exchanged content. One of the widely adopted agent communications is FIPA-ACL. An ontology for FIPA-ACL has been developed in previous work. However, the developed ontology does not incorporate any semantic model. Hence, in this paper, SPIN notation is used to model the social semantic of FIPA-ACL as it is able to link the class definition with SPARQL queries to capture rules and constraints to formalize the expected behaviour of classes. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Agent communication language; FIPA-ACL; OWL; Semantic web; Social commitment; SPIN","High level languages; Ontology; Semantic Web; Software agents; Agent Communication Languages; Agent communications; FIPA-ACL; High-level protocols; Social commitment; Software paradigm; SPIN; Standard protocols; Multi agent systems",,,,,,,,"Luck, M., McBurney, P., Shehory, O., Willmott, S., (2005) Agent Technology: Computing as Interaction. a Roadmap for Agent Based Computing, , University of Southampton on behalf of AgentLink III; Jennings, N.R., Sycara, K., Wooldridge, M., A roadmap of agent research and development (1998) Auton.

Objective: We aimed at building an algorithm for assessing semantic similarity of pairs of primary and reported outcomes.We focused on approaches that do not require manually curated domain-specific resources such as ontologies and thesauri. Methods: We tested several approaches, including single measures of similarity (based on strings, stems and lemmas, paths and distances in an ontology, and vector representations of phrases), classifiers using a combination of single measures as features, and a deep learning approach that consists in fine-tuning pre-trained deep language representations.We tested language models provided by BERT (trained on general-domain texts), BioBERT and SciBERT (trained on biomedical and scientific texts, respectively).We explored the possibility of improving the results by taking into account the variants for referring to an outcome (e.g.the use of a measurement tool name instead on the outcome name; the use of abbreviations).We release an open corpus with annotation for similarity of pairs of outcomes. Results: Classifiers using a combination of single measures as features outperformed the single measures, while deep learning algorithms using BioBERT and SciBERT models outperformed the classifiers.BioBERT reached the best F-measure of 89.75%.The addition of variants of outcomes did not improve the results for the best-performing single measures nor for the classifiers, but it improved the performance of deep learning algorithms: BioBERT achieved an F-measure of93.38%. Conclusions: Deep learning approaches using pre-trained language representations outperformed other approaches for similarity assessment of trial outcomes, without relying on any manually curated domain-specific resources (ontologies and other lexical resources). Addition of variants of outcomes further improved the performance of deep learning algorithms. © 2019 The Author(s)","Deep learning; Natural Language Processing; Pre-trained language representations; Semantic similarity; Spin detection; Trial outcomes","Deep learning; Medical applications; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; NAtural language processing; Pre-trained language representations; Semantic similarity; Spin detection; Trial outcomes; Learning algorithms; algorithm; article; classifier; clinical assessment; deep learning; human; human experiment; natural language processing; ontology",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020

In the context of a recent result by Spekkens that tells even in a ontological theory the unsharp observable cannot be assigned a deterministic response function, we derive a modified local bound of CHSH inequality in unsharp measurement scenario. We consider response function for a given POVM which is determined by the response functions of the relevant projectors appearing in its spectral representation. In this scenario, the local bound of CHSH inequality is found to be dependent on the unsharpness parameter. This then enables us to show that the quantum violation of CHSH inequality for unbiased spin-POVMs occurs whenever there is violation for their sharp counterpart. For the case of biased POVMs, it is shown that the quantum violation of CHSH inequality can be obtained for ranges of sharpness parameter for which no violation obtained using standard local bound of CHSH inequality. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bell’s inequality; Ontological model; Response function of POVM","Ontology; Hidden variable; Ontological modeling; Ontological theories; Response functions; Spectral representations; Bells",,,,,"Science and Engineering Research Board, SERB: SB/S2/RJN-083/2014","Authors gratefully acknowledge the discussion with Prof G.

Its flexibility motivated the use of this standard in other domains and today RDF datasets are big sources of information. In this line, the research on scalable distributed and parallel RDF processing systems has gained momentum. Most of these systems apply partitioning algorithms that use the triple, the finest logical data structure in RDF, as a distribution unit. This merely physical strategy implies losing the graph structure of the model causing performance degradation. We believe that gathering the triples storing the same logical entities first contributes not only to avoid scanning irrelevant data but also to create RDF partitions with an actual logical meaning. Besides, this logical representation allows defining partitions with a declarative language leaving aside implementation details. In this study, we give the formal definition and detail the algorithms to gather the logical entities, which we name graph fragments (Gf ), used as distribution units for RDF datasets. The logical entities proposed, harmonize with the notion of partitions by instances (horizontal) and by attributes (vertical) in the relational model. We propose allocation strategies for these fragments, considering the case when replication is available and in which both fragments by instances and by attributes are considered. We also discuss how to incorporate our declarative partitioning definition language to the existing state of the art systems. Our experiments in synthetic and real datasets show that graph fragments avert data skewness. In addition, we show that this type of data organization exhibits quantitative promise in certain types of queries. All of the above techniques are integrated into the same framework that we called RDFPartSuite. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Distributed computing; Partitioning; RDF","Advanced Analytics; Big data; Distributed computer systems; Graphic methods; Semantic Web; Declarative Languages; Logical representations; Partitioning; Partitioning algorithms; Performance degradation; Resource description framework; Sources of informations; State-of-the-art system; Parallel processing systems",,,,,,,,"Neumann, T., Moerkotte, G., Characteristic sets: Accurate cardinality estimation for RDF queries with multiple joins (2011) Proceedings of the 27Th ICDE, Hannover, Germany, 11–16 April, Pp. 984–994; Agrawal, S., Narasayya, V.R., Yang, B., Integrating vertical and horizontal partitioning into automated physical database design (2004) Proceedings of SIGMOD, Paris, France, 13–18 June, Pp. 359–370; Ramamurthy, R., Dewitt, D.J., Su, Q., A case for fractured mirrors (2002) Proceedings of 28Th VLDB 2002, Hong Kong, China, 20–23 August, Pp. 430–441; Galicia, J., Mesmoudi, A., Bellatreche, L., (2019) A Logic Dimension on RDF Partitioning, , Technical report; Karypis, G., Kumar, V., A fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs (1998) SIAM J.

We describe a mechanism of vacuum-state correlation of quanta in the neurobiological system with spatially and/or temporally separated systems, resulting in a co-dependency of states. This is evaluated in the context of how strong correlation of the dipole moments (of charge and spin) of residues in biological polymers, such as deoxyribonucleic acid and microtubulin, are involved in the information processing of awareness, particularly memory, and are entangled across spatial and temporal domains (spacetime). Coherent electromagnetic emissions from both water nanostructures and associated biomolecules may modulate the electronic properties and thus behaviors of supramolecular systems, representing a significant signaling and regulatory mechanism functioning in tandem to the strong correlation of the spin and electromagnetic dipoles of polarizable structures in biological macromolecules. Strong coherence across macromolecular structures of the biological system and extension through spacetime via entanglement resolves the binding problem associated with the generation of conscious awareness by the brain, as it is not only the result of supposed computational activity of neuronal networks, but the integration of information from multiple reference frames across the entanglement network of spacetime. The entanglement nexus of spacetime, herein referred to as the unified spacememory network, emerges as a component of some of the recent elaborations of quantum spacetime architecture in the holographic mass solution to quantum gravity and unification. This is taken in consideration with the Susskind-Maldacena conformal field theory holographic equivalence conjecture that demonstrates the correspondence of micro-wormholes of Planck-scale dimension with quantum entanglement, resolving the information loss paradox and providing a physical and ontological explanation for nonlocality observed in quantum behavior. Together, these concepts describe an architecture of spacetime that is built from information and quantum entanglement through a micro-wormhole network. Applying this model of unified physics to the question of consciousness it is shown how the unified spacememory network is pivotal to engendering fundamental characteristics of awareness that are actively utilized in the macromolecular information systems of the biological organism. © 2019, Anka Publishers.

We tested our approach one three Web of Things standards published respectively by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) and the oneM2M foundation. Our method extensively relies on Semantic Web technologies. First, observing that all standards provide a JSON representation of the data they specify, we generate an equivalent RDF representation by exploiting features of the recent JSON-LD format. We then define SPARQL inference rules, part of the new SHACL specification, to align the resulting RDF data with a unified ontology we call the Web of Things cloud. This ontology includes concepts from the SOSA, SSN, SAREF and SEAS ontologies. We evaluated our method by measuring the semantic similarity that exists between the standards OMA, OCF and oneM2M define. Our experiments show that the overlap between these standards is limited. Although all of them focus on the home & building automation domains, the schemas they provide cover different device types. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Internet of Things; IPSO; JSON-LD; LWM2M; OCF; OneM2M; OWL; Semantic integration; SHACL; SPIN; Web of Things","Data integration; Intelligent buildings; Ontology; Semantic Web; IPSO; JSON-LD; LWM2M; OneM2M; Semantic integration; SHACL; SPIN; Internet of things",,,,,,,,"(1991) 610-1991 - IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary: A Compilation of IEEE Standard Computer Glossaries, , Ieee standard; (2015) ITU-T Y.2060 - Overview of The Internet of Things.

However, the scale and heterogeneity of the involved data, together with the need for associating environmental information with physical reality, increase the complexity of the problem. In this work, we capitalize on the semantic expressiveness of ontologies to build a framework that uniformly covers all phases of the decision making process: from structuring and integration of data, to inference of new knowledge. We define a simplified ontology schema for representing the status of the environment and its impact on citizens’ health and actions. We also implement a novel ontology- and rule-based reasoning mechanism for generating personalized recommendations, capable of treating differently individuals with diverse levels of vulnerability under poor air quality conditions. The overall framework is easily adaptable to new sources and needs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Air quality recommendations; Ontology; OWL 2; Personalized decision support; SPIN; User profiling","Air quality; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Ontology; Semantics; Decision support framework; Decision supports; Environmental decision support systems; Environmental information; OWL 2; Personalized recommendation; SPIN; User profiling; Decision support systems",,,,,"European Commission, EC: H2020-688363 hackAIR","Acknowledgments.

Being supported by Protégé as well as by popular rule engines and ontology reasoners, such as Jess, Drools and Pellet, SWRL has become a very popular choice for developing rule-based applications on top of ontologies. However, being doubtful whether SWRL will become a W3C standard, it is difficult to reach out to the industrial world. On the other hand, SPIN has become a de-facto industry standard to represent SPARQL rules and constraints on Semantic Web models, building on the widespread acceptance of the SPARQL query language. In this paper, we argue that the life of existing SWRL rule-based ontology applications can be prolonged by being transformed into SPIN. To this end, we have developed a prototype tool using SWI-Prolog that takes as input an OWL ontology with a SWRL rule base and transforms SWRL rules into SPIN rules in the same ontology, taking into consideration the object-oriented scent of SPIN, i.e. linking rules to the appropriate ontology classes as derived by analyzing the rule conditions. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Despite the importance of this topic, there is so far no accepted consensus regarding the precise way of encoding and even more reasoning on contextual knowledge. In this paper, we introduce an approach to reason over contextual knowledge in RDF, while committing to the semantics of a contextual description logic. The lines of this paper are many folds. First, we present an extension of OWL 2 DL for contexts, that we call OWL 2 DLC. It is a two-dimensional web ontology language with one dimension for contextualized object knowledge and one dimension for contexts. Second, we define an OWLC profile for contextual reasoning, similar to OWL 2 RL. And finally, we demonstrate that the model can be practically implemented using existing semantic web technologies, especially using SPIN rules.

The aims of this paper are (a) to describe what will be called dualaxiomatics, for it concerns not just the formalism, but also the meaning (reference and sense) of the key concepts; and (b) to suggest that every instance of dual axiomatics presupposes some philosophical view or other. To illustrate these points, a theory of solidarity will be crafted and axiomatized, and certain controversies in both classical and quantum physics, as well as in the philosophy of mind, will be briefly discussed. The upshot of this paper is that dual axiomatics, unlike the purely formal axiomatics favored by the structuralists school, is not a luxury but a tool helping resolve some scientific controversies. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Axiomatics; Dual axiomatics; Philosophy of mind; Primitive; Quantum theory; Semantic assumption; Spin structuralism","Philosophical aspects; Quantum theory; Semantics; Axiomatics; Axiomatization; Hilbert; Philosophy of mind; Primitive; Quantum physics; Spin structuralism; Ontology",,,,,,,,"Adler-Lomnitz, L., (1975) Cómo sobreviven los marginados, , Siglo xxi, México; Bunge, M., (1967) Foundations of Physics, , Springer, Berlin; Bunge, M., A ghost-free axiomatizaton of quantum mechanics (1967) Quantum Theory and Reality, pp. 105-117. , Bunge M, (ed), Springer, Berlin; Bunge, M., Analogy in quantum mechanics: From insight to nonsense (1967) British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 18, pp. 265-286; Bunge, M., The structure and contnt of a physical theory (1967) Delaware Seminar in the Foundations of Physics, pp. 15-27. , Bunge M, (ed), Springer, New York; Bunge, M., Review of wolfgang stegmüller's the structure and dynamics of theories (1976) Mathematical Reviews, 55, p. 33; Bunge, M., The Einstein-Bohr debate over quantum mechanics: Who was right about what?

On this basis, cultural anthropology has engaged infrastructure as vehicles through which political values and symbols are made manifest. In contrast, this introduction, and the contributions that follow, specifies an orientation to infrastructures as ontological experiments. At issue is a view of infrastructures as experimental systems that integrate a multiplicity of disjunctive elements and spin out new relations between them. The result is the creation and transformation of different forms of practical, materialized ontologies, which give shape to culture, society, and politics. Given that these transformations are often slow and incremental, they often unfold under the radar of anthropological analysis. However, we argue that it is important for the anthropology of infrastructure to find ways of bringing their world-changing capacities into view. The paper ends with a brief introduction to the contributions of the special issue. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Culture; experimental systems; infrastructures; ontologies;

One of the challenges of adopting SWT for enterprise data integration is to provide the means to define and validate structural constraints over Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs. This is difficult since RDF graph axioms behave like implications instead of structural constraints. SWT researchers and practitioners have proposed several solutions to address this challenge (e.g., SPIN and Shape Expression). However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them provide an integrated solution within open source ontology editors (e.g., Protégé). We identified this absence of the integrated solution and developed SHACL4P, a Protégé plugin for defining and validating Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), the upcoming W3C standard for constraint validation within Protégé ontology editor. © 2016 IEEE.","Constraint Validation; Protégé Plugin; RDF Graph; SHACL","Ontology; Open source software; Semantic Web; Software engineering; Constraint Validation; Constraints validations; Plug-ins; RDF graph; Resource description framework; Semantic Web technology; SHACL; Structural constraints; Data integration",,,,,"Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, CDG","This work was supported by the Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft, the Federal Ministry of Economy, Family and Youth and bsterreichischer Austauschdienst (bAD).

They are available for diverse diseases/conditions and routinely used in many countries, providing reference material for healthcare delivery in clinical settings. As CPGs are paper-based, i.e. plain documents, there have been various approaches for their computerization and expression in a formal manner so that they can be incorporated in clinical information and decision support systems. Semantic Web technologies and ontologies have been extensively used for CPG formalization. In this paper, we present a novel method for the representation and execution of CPGs using OWL ontologies and SPARQL-based inference rules. The proposed approach is capable of expressing complex CPG constructs and can be used to express formalisms, such as negations, which are hard to express using ontologies alone. The encapsulation of SPARQL rules in the CPG ontology is based on the SPARQL Inference Notation (SPIN). The proposed representation of different aspects of CPGs, such as numerical comparisons, calculations, decision branches and state transitions, and their execution is demonstrated through the respective parts of comprehensive, though complex enough, CPGs for arterial hypertension management. The paper concludes by comparing the proposed approach with other relevant works, indicating its potential and limitations, as well as a future work directions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Clinical practice guidelines (CPG); CPG modelling and representation; Hypertension management; Ontologies; Semantic web; SPARQL inference notation (SPIN)","Artificial intelligence; Cardiology; Decision support systems; Health care; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantic Web; Arterial hypertension; Clinical information; Clinical practice guidelines; CPG modelling and representation; Health care professionals; Numerical comparison; Semantic Web technology; SPARQL inference notation (SPIN); Decision making",,,,,,,,"Field, M.J., Lohr, K.N., (1992) Guidelines for Clinical Practice: From Development to Use, , National Academies Press; Eagle, K.A., Montoye, C.K., Riba, A.L., Defranco, A.C., Parrish, R., Skorcz, S., Baker, P.L., Chen, B., Guideline-based standardized care is associated with substantially lower mortality in medicare patients with acute myocardial infarction: The American College of Cardiologys Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP) Projects in Michigan (2005) J.

Rule languages complement ontology languages. For large heterogeneous bodies of knowledge on the semantic web, contextualized knowledge repositories facilitate the organization of ontological concepts. In this paper we propose a similar mechanism - contextualized rule repositories - for organizing and executing large sets of context-specific rules. We investigate feasibility of a SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) based implementation using a real-world use case from the aeronautical domain. Furthermore, we compare SPIN-based contextualized rule repositories to a context-unaware SPIN implementation.","Business rules; Context; Ontologies; SPIN","Ontology; Business rules; Context; Contextualized knowledge; Contextualized rules; Ontology language; Real-world; SPIN; Semantic Web",,,,,"FFG-839006","Acknowledgments.

Effectively querying this distributed data source is an important open problem in the Semantic Web area. In this paper, we propose LDQL, a declarative language to query Linked Data on the Web. One of the novelties of LDQL is that it expresses separately (i) patterns that describe the expected query result, and (ii) Web navigation paths that select the data sources to be used for computing the result. We present a formal syntax and semantics, prove equivalence rules, and study the expressiveness of the language. In particular, we show that LDQL is strictly more expressive than all the query formalisms that have been proposed previously for Linked Data on the Web. We also study some computability issues regarding LDQL. We first prove that when considering the Web of Linked Data as a fully accessible graph, the evaluation problem for LDQL can be solved in polynomial time. Nevertheless, when the limited data access capabilities of Web clients are considered, the scenario changes drastically; there are LDQL queries for which a complete execution is not possible in practice. We formally study this issue and provide a sufficient syntactic condition to avoid this problem; queries satisfying this condition are ensured to have a procedure to be effectively evaluated over the Web of Linked Data. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Foundations; Linked Data; Queries; Query language; SPARQL","Data handling; Foundations; Polynomial approximation; Query languages; Syntactics; Declarative Languages; Distributed data sources; Equivalence rule; Evaluation problems; Formal syntaxes; Linked datum; Queries; SPARQL; Semantic Web",,,,,"NC120004

Accessing information required to execute the tasks is a common challenge for maintenance personnel. This paper presents a knowledge modeling approach and a technical architecture of a gateway system developed to support maintenance personnel with information combined from legacy data sources as well as from context ontology augmented with situational knowledge. The novelty of the approach is its unified object oriented style of knowledge representation encapsulating predefined queries and rules into ontology classes. The approach utilizes standard Semantic Web technologies, especially SPARQL query language and SPARQL Inferencing Notation SPIN. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with a simple maintenance use case example executed in an experimental knowledge gateway system. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Factory automation; Knowledge representation; Query languages; Context modeling; Context ontology; Experimental knowledge; Industrial maintenance; Maintenance personnel; Semantic Web technology; Service personnel; Technical architecture; Maintenance",,,,,,,,"Murthy, D., Karim, M., Ahmadi, A., Data management in maintenance outsourcing (2015) Reliability Engineering & System Safety, 142, pp. 100-110; Hästbacka, D., Aarnio, P., Vyatkin, V., Kuikka, S., Empowering industrial maintenance personnel with situationally relevant information using semantics and context reasoning (2015) Proceedings of the 7th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, pp. 182-192; Perera, C., Zaslavsky, A., Christen, P., Georgakopoulos, D., Context aware computing for the internet of things: A survey (2014) Communications Surveys Tutorials, IEEE, 16 (1), pp. 414-454. , First; Hong, J., Suh, E., Kim, S., Context-aware systems: A literature review and classification (2009) Expert Systems with Applications, 36 (4), pp. 8509-8522. , http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417408007574; Bettini, C., Brdiczka, O., Henricksen, K., Indulska, J., Nicklas, D., Ranganathan, A., Riboni, D., A survey of context modelling and reasoning techniques (2010) Pervasive Mob.

This paper proposed a formal modeling and verification method based on common information model. Considering the imprecision and ambiguity of UML in the modeling process, we constructed the formal definitions and logical descriptions for objects, logics and scenes of the information model, followed by the derivation of ontology rules and propositions. To verify whether the model possesses the expected semantic features, formal verification method is generalized using underlying logics and semantics derived from the ontology rules. Later on, the formal verification tool SPIN is applied to the distribution control area model as an example for formal verification to ensure the synchronization of semantics and structure for data exchange process between information models. a)The formal symbols in this paper adopt the following conventions: b)The formal expressions conform with Backus Naur form, BNF; c)The capital letters represent sets, lowercase letters denote the elements: tT; Definitions use the combination of numbers: 2-3; Rules use number and uppercase letter combination: 2-A; Inference use number and lowercase letter combination: 2-d; © 2016 IEEE.","formal modeling and verification; information model; linear temporal logic; smart distribution grid","Electric utilities; Electronic data interchange; Information theory; Semantics; Common information model; Distribution control; Formal modeling and verification; Formal verification methods; Formal verification tools; Information Modeling; Linear temporal logic; Smart distribution grids; Formal verification",,,,,,,,"(2001) EPRI.

Dirac’s development of his theory of the electron, and its radical picture of empty space as an almost-full plenum. Dirac’s Quantum Electrodynamics famously accomplished more than the unification of special relativity and quantum mechanics. It also accounted for the ‘duplexity phenomena’ of spectral line splitting that we now attribute to electron spin. But the extra mathematical terms that allowed for spin were not alone, and this paper charts Dirac’s struggle to ignore or account for them as a sea of strange, negative-energy, particles with positive ‘holes’. This work was not done in solitude, but rather in exchanges with Dirac’s correspondence network. This social context for Dirac’s work contests his image as a lone genius, and documents a community wrestling with the ontological consequences of their work. Unification, consistency, causality, and community are common factors in explanations in the history of physics. This paper argues on the basis of materials in Dirac’s archive that-in addition- mathematical beauty was an epistemological factor in the development of the electron and hole theory. In fact, if we believe that Dirac’s beautiful mathematics captures something of the world, then there is both an epistemology and an ontology of mathematical beauty. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Electrodynamics; Magnetic moments; Quantum electronics; Quantum theory; Relativity; Common factors; Electron spins; History of physics; Hole theories; Quantum electrodynamics; Social context; Special relativity; Spectral line; Electrospinning; electron; history; knowledge; physics; vacuum; Electrons; History, 20th Century; Knowledge; Physics; Vacuum",,,,,,,,"Darrigol, O., (1992) From c-Numbers to Q-Numbers: The Classical Analogy in the History of Quantum Theory, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Pais, A., Playing with equations, the Dirac way (1998) Paul Dirac: The man and his work, pp. 93-116 and 96-97. , ed. by Peter Goddard (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Dirac, P.A.M., The Physical Interpretation of the Quantum Dynamics (1927) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

SPARQL is used as a standardised declarative language for aggregating, interpreting and enriching low-level contextual RDF knowledge bases with higher level derivations. The proposed SPARQL-based reasoning framework supports key inferencing tasks that are important in activity interpretation domains, but not supported by the standard semantics of OWL 2, such as temporal reasoning and dynamic assertion of structured individuals. In order to promote the extensibility and reuse of the underlying interpretation semantics, the reasoning framework is further enhanced with a conceptual layer that allows the formal representation of activity meta-knowledge by means of DOLCE+DnS Ultralite (DUL) ontology patterns. We illustrate the capabilities of the proposed framework through its deployment in a hospital for monitoring activities of Alzheimer's disease patients. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we deal with problems regarding understanding evolution, focusing on RDF(S) knowledge bases, as RDF is a de-facto standard for representing data on the web. We argue that revisiting past snapshots or the differences between them is not enough for understanding how and why data evolved. Instead, changes should be treated as first-class-citizens. In our view, this involves supporting semantically rich, user-defined changes that we call complex changes, as well as identifying the interrelations between them. In this paper, we present our perspective regarding complex changes, propose a declarative language for defining complex changes for RDF(S) knowledge bases, and show how this language is used to detect complex change instances among dataset versions.

Effectively querying this distributed data source is an important open problem in the Semantic Web area. In this paper, we propose LDQL, a declarative language to query Linked Data on the Web. One of the novelties of LDQL is that it expresses separately (i) patterns that describe the expected query result, and (ii)Web navigation paths that select the data sources to be used for computing the result. We present a formal syntax and semantics, prove equivalence rules, and study the expressiveness of the language. In particular, we show that LDQL is strictly more expressive than the query formalisms that have been proposed previously for Linked Data on the Web. The high expressiveness allows LDQL to define queries for which a complete execution is not computationally feasible over the Web. We formally study this issue and provide a syntactic sufficient condition to avoid this problem; queries satisfying this condition are ensured to have a procedure to be effectively evaluated over the Web of Linked Data. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Data handling; Linked data; Query languages; Syntactics; Data-sources; Declarative Languages; Distributed data sources; Equivalence rule; Formal syntaxes; Query results; Semantic data; Web navigation; Semantic Web",,,,,"NC120004

These standard models need to support diverse domain-specific requirements from the multitude of disciplines involved during a product's lifecycle. Due to this diversity, challenges are to: 1) develop multidisciplinary models; 2) extend them to support new requirements over time; 3) implement the resulting gigantic information models. ISO 10303, the reference standard for PLM-related data models provides mechanisms to enable specialisation of generic product data to address some of these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the need for dynamic product data models, detail the ISO method and identify its limitations. We present enhancements to that methodology using ontologies and the SPARQL Inference Notation (SPIN) for validating product data. To conclude, we show how these ontologies can be leveraged to ease and strengthen PLM data integration through the use of Linked Data.

SPARQL is a declarative language on RDF graphs which allows a user to precisely specify the desired information. In contrast, a recommender system suggests certain items to a user, based on similarity to other users or items. As the data to be processed by a recommender may be an RDF graph as well, the question arises whether both processing paradigms can benefit from each other. RecSPARQL fills this gap by extending the syntax and semantics of SPARQL to enable a generic and exible way for collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations over arbitrary RDF graphs. Our experiments on the MovieLens data set demonstrate the applicability of our approach.

In the Semantic Web realm, this surge of analytics languages was not reflected despite the significant growth in the available RDF data. Consequently, when analysing large RDF datasets, users are left with two main options: Using SPARQL or using an existing non-RDF-specific big data language, both with its own limitations. The pure declarative nature of SPARQL and the high cost of evaluation can be limiting in some scenarios. On the other hand, existing big data languages are designed mainly for tabular data and, therefore, applying them to RDF data results in verbose, unreadable, and sometimes inefficient scripts. In this paper, we introduce SYRql, a dataflow language designed to process RDF data at a large scale. SYRql blends concepts from both SPARQL and existing big data languages. We formally define a closed algebra that underlies SYRql and discuss its properties and some unique optimisation opportunities this algebra provides. Furthermore, we describe an implementation that translates SYRql scripts into a series of MapReduce jobs and compare the performance to other big data processing languages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Algebra; Data handling; Semantic Web; Data flow language; Declarative Languages; Distributed computations; High costs; Large-scale processing; Map-reduce; Optimisations; Tabular data; Big data",,,,,"SFI/12/RC/2289",,,"Abiteboul, S., Quass, D., McHugh, J., Widom, J., Wiener, J.L., The lorel query language for semistructured data (1997) International Journal on Digital Libraries; Agrawal, R., (2008) The Claremont Report on Database Research, , SIGMOD Rec; Anyanwu, K., Sheth, A., P-queries: Enabling querying for semantic associations on the semantic web (2003) WWW; Beyer, K.S., Ercegovac, V., Gemulla, R., Balmin, A., Eltabakh, M.Y., Kanne, C.-C., Özcan, F., Shekita, E.J., Jaql: A Scripting Language for Large Scale Semistructured Data Analysis (2011) PVLDB; Bizer, C., Schultz, A., The Berlin SPARQL Benchmark (2009) IJSWIS; Buneman, P., Fernandez, M., Suciu, D., UnQL: A Query Language and Algebra for Semistructured Data Based on Structural Recursion (2000) VLDB; Chamberlin, D.D., Boyce, R.F., SEQUEL: A Structured English Query Language (1974) SIGFIDET; Codd, E.F., A Data Base Sublanguage Founded on the Relational Calculus (1971) SIGFIDET; Dean, J., Ghemawat, S., MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters (2004) OSDI; Dries, A., Nijssen, S., De Raedt, L., A Query Language for Analyzing Networks (2009) CIKM; Hagedorn, S., Sattler, K.-U., Efficient Parallel Processing of Analytical Queries on Linked Data (2013) ODBASE 2013.

Further basic assumptions of the proposed interpretation are completeness, universality and conceptual economy. In the interpretation, decoherence plays a fundamental role for the understanding of measurement. A general and precise conception of complementarity is proposed. It is fundamental in this interpretation to make a distinction between ontological reality, constituted by everything that does not depend at all on the collectivity of human beings, nor on their decisions or limitations, nor on their existence, and empirical reality constituted by everything that not being ontological is, however, intersubjective. According to the proposed interpretation, neither the dynamical properties, nor the constitutive properties of microsystems like mass, charge and spin, are ontological. The properties of macroscopic systems and space-time are also considered to belong to empirical reality. The acceptance of the above mentioned conclusion does not imply a total rejection of the notion of ontological reality. In the paper, utilizing the Aristotelian ideas of general cause and potentiality, a relation between ontological reality and empirical reality is proposed. Some glimpses of ontological reality, in the form of what can be said about it, are finally presented. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bohr; Empirical and ontological reality; Indivisibility and complementarity; Mind and Matter; Potentiality; Quantum mechanics",,,,,,,,,"de Broglie, L., La mécanique ondulatoire et la structure atomique de la matière et du rayonnement (1927) J.

More specifically, the native semantics of OWL is used to formally represent and integrate activity-related information originated from different data sources, whereas SPARQL (SPIN) rules further aggregate activities so as to derive high-level activity abstractions. The goal of the hybrid framework is to address the limitations of the ontology-based context modelling paradigm in domains that require the recognition of complex context elements, namely, the lack of support for (i) temporal reasoning and (ii) new named individual assertions. © 2013 IEEE.","activity recognition; context; OWL; SPARQL","Activity recognition; context; Context elements; Context-aware environments; Ontology-based context; OWL; SPARQL; Temporal reasoning; Pattern recognition; Semantics; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 288199",,,"McGuinness, D.L., Van Harmelen, F., OWL web ontology language overview (2004) World Wide Web Consortium, W3C Recommendation, , Feb; Grau, B.C., Horrocks, I., Motik, B., Parsia, B., Patel-Schneider, P., Sattler, U., OWL 2: The next step for OWL (2008) Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 6 (4), pp. 309-322. , October; Bettini, C., Brdiczka, O., Henricksen, K., Indulska, J., Nicklas, D., Ranganathan, A., Riboni, D., A survey of context modelling and reasoning techniques (2010) Pervasive Mob.

Conclusions: Evidence-based medicine is founded on a 'scientific' ontology of 'causality', which equates 'truth' with effecting statistically-significant changes in objective measures of disease by a specified treatment. Because of the absence of biological markers of disease in psychiatry, evidence-based psychiatry equates 'truth' with effecting changes in observable psychometric measures of behaviour. This is the same ontology underlying marketing 'spin' and all attempts to effect pre-determined behavioural change. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty's ontology rejects causality and mind/body duality, and views 'truth' as the expression of our deepest embodied feeling and perception of the world, which establishes all our thinking, and on which all our thinking relies, including 'scientific' thinking. Merleau-Ponty's ontology is therefore a preferable foundation for psychiatric practice, because it allows psychiatrists to consider the 'truth' of clinically important, but non-measurable, aspects of psychiatry while not excluding 'scientific' thinking, but recognising its limitations and potential for misuse. © The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2013.","Evidence-based medicine; Merleau-Ponty; Ontology; Philosophy; Psychometric measures; Truth","article; behavior change; clinical practice; evidence based medicine; evidence based practice; human; phenomenology; psychiatrist; psychiatry; evidence-based medicine; Merleau-Ponty; ontology; philosophy; psychometric measures; truth; Evidence-Based Medicine; Existentialism; Humans; Psychiatry; Psychological Theory",,,,,,,,"Morstyn, R., Merleau-Ponty and me: Some phenomenological reflections upon my recent bone marrow transplant (2009) Australas Psychiatry, 17, pp. 237-239; Morstyn, R., How the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty can help us understand the gulf between clinical experience and the doctrine of evidence-based psychotherapy (2010) Australas Psychiatry, 18, pp. 221-225; Morstyn, R., Dangerous 'spin': The probability myth of evidence-based prescribing - A Merleau-Pontyian approach (2011) Australas Psychiatry, 19, pp. 295-300; Merleau-Ponty, M., Eye and mind (2007) The Merleau-Ponty Reader, pp. 351-378. , Toadvine T and Lawlor L (eds).

The mapping definitions can be given a URI and shared along with the data to be visualized, they can be composed, extended and reused. The declarative approach has the benefit that this can be done independently of specific platforms. Unlike styling or presentation languages for RDF or pure visualization languages, RVL combines rich visual mapping capabilities with the direct awareness of RDFS/OWL language constructs.

However, many of these devices are specialized, operate independently and use proprietary interfaces, diluting the cost savings. Smartphones offer a way to retain these cost savings by serving as a sensor hub within the home. In this paper we describe an extensible framework that combines a mobile device interfacing with health sensors in the home, a set of ontologies to map sensor data to clinical information standards such as IEEE 11073, and a cloud-based reasoning and mapping system built with OWL, SPARQL and SPIN.

During the last decade, there has been intense research and development in creating methodologies and tools able to map Relational Databases with the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Although some systems have gained wider acceptance in the Semantic Web community, they either require users to learn a declarative language for encoding mappings or, in case they support friendly user interfaces, they provide limited expressivity. Thereupon, we present RDOTE, a framework for easily transporting data residing in Relational Databases into the Semantic Web. RDOTE is available under GNU/GPL license and it provides friendly graphical user interfaces, as well as enough expressivity for creating automatic and custom RDF dumps of relational data. RDOTE is also compatible with D2RQ and R2RML mapping definitions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We describe a method of pre-processing such rules for use in abductive reasoning. We also describe rule selection and re-query formulation methods once a set of A-Box statements is presented to the abductive reasoner.

Product data models enable information exchange across different organizations, actors, processes and stages in the product lifecycle. In this context, standardization of models plays a key role, since it ensures interoperability between the different systems that support information exchange. These standard models need to support diverse domain-specific requirements from the multitude of disciplines involved during a product's lifecycle. Due to this diversity, challenges are to (1) develop multidisciplinary reusable models, (2) extend them to support new requirements over time (new products, new regulations, new materials, new processes) and (3) implement the resulting gigantic information models. ISO 10303, the reference standard for PLM-related data models provides two mechanisms that enable specialization of generic product data to address some of these challenges. In this paper we introduce the need for dynamic PLM-related information models, detail the existing ISO 10303 method and identify its limitations. We then present a methodology for enhancing that method using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and ontologies for representing product data models and the SPARQL Inference Notation (SPIN), a new Semantic Web technology, for validating product data and overcoming OWL limitations. © 2012 International Federation for Information Processing.",,"Domain specific; Generic products; Information exchanges; Information models; ISO 10303; New product; Product data; Product data model; Product life cycle management; Product-life-cycle; Reference standard; Robust solutions; Semantic Web technology; Standard model; Web ontology language; Information dissemination; Information theory; Interoperability; Models; Life cycle",,,,,,,,"Pratt, M.J., Introduction to ISO 10303 - The STEP Standard for Product Data Exchange (2001) Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, 1, p. 102; Mehta, C., Patil, L., Dutta, D., STEP in the Context of PLM (2009) Advanced Design and Manufacturing Based on STEP, pp. 383-397. , Springer, London; (2002) Industrial Automation Systems and Integration - Product Data Representation and Exchange - Part 21: Implementation Methods: Clear Text Encoding of the Exchange Structure, , ISO: 10303-21; Reference Data, , http://www.plcs-resources.org/plcs/dexlib/help/dex/techdes_refdata.htm, OASIS; (2005) Industrial Automation Systems and Integration - Prod-uct Data Representation and Exchange - Part 239: Application Protocol: Prod-uct Life Cycle Support, , ISO: 10303-239; OWL Web Ontology Language, , http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/; Krima, S., Barbau, R., Fiorentini, X., Rachuri, S., Foufou, S., Sriram, R.D., OntoSTEP: OWL-DL ontology for STEP (2009) Proceedings of the International Conference on Product Lifecycle Management, PLM 2009, July 6-8, pp. 770-780. , Inderscience Publishers, Bath; Elçi, A., Rahnama, B., Kamran, S., Defining a Strategy to Select Either of Closed/Open World Assumptions on Semantic Robots (2008) 32nd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference, July 28-August 1, pp. 417-423. , IEEE; Motik, B., Horrocks, I., Sattler, U., Adding Integrity Constraints to OWL (2007) Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on OWL: Experiences and Directions, June 6-7, , CEUR; Sirin, E., Tao, J., Towards Integrity Constraints in OWL (2009) Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on OWL: Experiences and Directions, October 23-24, , CEUR; Knublauch, H., Hendler, J.A., Idehen, K., SPIN - Overview and Motivation, , http://www.w3.org/Submission/spin-overview/; Srinivasan, V., Lämmer, L., Vettermann, S., On architecting and implementing a product information sharing service (2008) Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, 8, pp. 110061-1100611; Lämmer, L., Bugow, R., PLM Services in Practice (2007) The Future of Product Development Proceedings of the 17th CIRP Design Conference, March 27-28, pp. 503-512. , Krause, F.L.

The proliferations of ontologies and meta-information have improved the understanding of information and the relevance of search engine responses. However, the construction of semantic graphs is a source of numerous errors of interpretation or modeling, and scalability remains a major problem. The processing of large semantic graphs is a limit to the use of semantics in current information systems. The work presented in this paper is part of a new research at the border of two areas: the semantic web and the model checking. This line of research concerns the adaptation of model checking techniques to semantic graphs. We present a first method of converting RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs into NμSMV and PROMELA (Process Meta Language) languages in order to be checked with the temporal logic property and queried by the temporal logic query. SPARQL (Simple Protocol and RDF query Language) query language is the standard for querying the Semantic Web, but it has a lot of limitations. Our primary goal with the temporal logic query is to overcome this limitation of the SPARQL query language. To reach this goal, three tools have been developed. The first two tools ""RDF2SPIN"" and ""RDF2NμSMV"" are used to transform the Semantic graph into a model written in PROMELA and respectively in NμSMV languages - in order to be understood by the SPIN and respectively the NμSMV model checkers. The STL Resolver tool is used to find solutions to the temporal logic query. It is based on the model checking algorithms. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Model checking; Semantic graph; SPARQL; Temporal logic; Temporal logic query","Meta information; Meta language; Model checking algorithm; Model-checking techniques; PROMELA; Query semantics; RDF query language; Resource description framework; Semantic graphs; Semantic interoperability; SIMPLE protocol; SMV model; SPARQL; Temporal logic properties; Model checking; Query languages; Search engines; Semantic Web; Temporal logic; Graphic methods",,,,,,,,"Bray, T., Paoli, J., Sperberg-McQueen, C., Maler, V., Yergeau, E., Cowan, J.F., (2006) Extensible Markup Language (XML), , 1.1 (second edition) W3C recommendation; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The Semantic Web (2001) Scientific American, pp. 34-43; Kahan, J., Koivunen, M., Prud'Hommeaux, E., Swick, R.R., Annotea: An Open RDF Infrastructure for Shared Web Annotations (2001) Proc. of the WWW 10th International Conference, , in Hong Kong; Katoen, J.P., (2002) The princiapl of Model Checking, , University of Twente; Homma, K., Takahashi, K., Togashi, A., Modeling and Verification of Web Applications Using Formal Approach (2009) IEICE Tech.

It builds upon established Web technologies, in particular HTTP and URIs, extended with Semantic Web representation formats and protocols such as RDF, RDFS, OWL and SPARQL, by which data from different sources can be shared, interconnected and used beyond the application scenarios for which it was originally created. RDF is a central building block of the Linked Data technology stack. It is a graph-based data model based on the idea of making statements about (information and non-information) resources on the Web in terms of triples of the form subject predicate object. The object of any RDF triple may be used in the subject position in other triples, leading to a directed, labeled graph typically referred to as an 'RDF graph'. Both nodes and edges in such graphs are identified via URIs; nodes represent Web resources, while edges stand for attributes of such resources or properties connecting them. Schema information can be expressed using languages such as RDFS and OWL, by which resources can be typed as classes described in terms of domain-specific attributes, properties and constraints. RDF graphs can be natively queried using the query language SPARQL. A SPARQL query is composed of graph patterns and can be stored as RDF triples together with any RDF domain model using SPIN to facilitate the definition of constraints and inference rules in ontologies.

After its proposal, in a seminal paper by Michael Gelfond and Vladimir Lifschitz dated in 1988, ASP has been the subject of a broad theoretical research-work, ranging from linguistic extensions and semantic properties to evaluation algorithm and optimization techniques. Later on, the availability of a number of efficient systems made ASP a powerful tool for the fast development of knowledge-based applications. In this paper, we report on the ongoing effort aimed at the industrial exploitation of DLV - one of the most popular ASP systems - in the area of Knowledge Management. Two spin-off companies of University of Calabria are involved in such an exploitation: Dlvsystem Srl and Exeura Srl. They have specialized DLV into some Knowledge Management products for Text Classification, Information Extraction, and Ontology Representation and Reasoning, which have allowed to develop a number of successful real-world applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Applications; ASP; DLV System; Knowledge Management","Answer set programming; ASP; Declarative Languages; DLV System; Efficient systems; Evaluation algorithm; Information Extraction; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Knowledge-based applications; Optimization techniques; Real-world application; Semantic properties; Spin-off companies; Text classification; Answer set programming; Declarative Languages; DLV system; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Knowledge-based applications; Ontology representations; Optimization techniques; Theoretical research; Classification (of information); Computation theory; Engineering research; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Logic programming; Ontology; Semantics; Text processing; Applications; Classification (of information); Computer programming; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Logic programming; Semantics; Text processing; Computer systems programming; Data mining",,,,,,,,"Alviano, M., Faber, W., Leone, N., Disjunctive ASP with functions: Decidable queries and effective computation (2010) TPLP, 26th Int'l.

In this work, the solution to verification of O-RGPS, which gives a meta-model for requirement modelling of large-scale networked software, is proposed. Firstly, adopting hybrid reasoning way, consistency of domain knowledge is checked and then inference is made to acquire potential information. Moreover, web services aggregation in S-Iayer is described with BPEL4WS, which is converted to promela presentation, and then reliability problems such as deadlock, reachability and so on are verified with model checker tool SPIN. As a result, it makes sure that the final requirement specifications of O-RGPS framework are faithful. © 2010 IEEE.","Model checking; O-RGPS; Ontology reasoning; Requirement verification; Web services",,,,,,,,,"Lamsweerde, A.V., Goal-oriented requirements engineering: A guilded tour (2001) Proc. of the 5th IEEE International Sysmposium on Requirements Engineering, pp. 249-263. , Toronto,Canada; Griss, M.L., Favaro, J., D'Alessandro, M., Integrating feature modeling with the RSEB (1998) Proc. of the 15th International Conference on Software Reuse, pp. 76-85; Falbo, R.A., Guizzardi, G., Duarte, K.C., An ontological approach to domain engineering (2002) LNCS, 2503, pp. 167-181. , Proc of the International Conference on software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE'02); Wang, J., He, K., Li, B., Liu, W., Peng, R., Meta-models of domain modeling framework for networked software (2007) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing, pp. 878-885. , Urumchi, China, August; Wang, J., He, K., Gong, P., Wang, C., RGPS: A unified requirements meta-modeling frame for networked software (2008) Proc of Third International Workshop on Advances and Applications of Problem Frames(IWAAPF'08) at 30th International Conference on Software Engineering(ICSE'08), pp. 29-35. , Leipzig, Germany; Obito, M., (2007) Ontologies and Semantic Web OWL DL Semantics, , http://www.obitko.com/tutorials/ontologies-semantic-web/owl-dlsemantics. html; Baader, F., Calvanese, D., McGuinness, D.J., Nardi, D., Patel-Schneider, P.F., (2003) The Description Logic Handbook Theory, Implementation Applications, pp. 1-99. , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, ISBN 0-521-78176-0; Horrocks, I., Patel-Schneider, P.F., Boley, H., Tabet, S., (2004) SWRL A Semantic Web Rule Language Combining OWL and RuleML, , http://www.w3.org/Submissionl2004/SUBM-SWRL-20040521/, 5-21; Clarke, E.M., Grumberg, O., Peled, D., (1999) Model Checking, , MIT Press; Andrews, T., Curbera, F., Dholakia, H., Goland, Y., (2003) Business Process Execution Language for Web Services Version 1.1, , http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/specificationlws-bpe1/, 5 May; Ben-Ari, M., (2008) Principles of the Spin Model Checker, pp. 29-44. , Springer Verlag","Zhenxing, X.; Chengdu Institute of Computer Applications, , Chengdu, China; email: freemanxzx@163.com",,"Int.

Hence, it will soon be critical to manage the quality of such data. Unfortunately, we can observe a wide range of data quality problems in Semantic Web data. In this paper, we (1) evaluate how the state of the art in data quality research fits the characteristics of the Web of Data, (2) describe how the SPARQL query language and the SPARQL Inferencing Notation (SPIN) can be utilized to identify data quality problems in Semantic Web data automatically and this within the Semantic Web technology stack, and (3) evaluate our approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","Data quality management; Linked data; Ontologies; Ontology-based data quality management; RDF; Semantic web; SPARQL; SPIN","Information systems; Ontology; Quality control; Quality management; Query languages; Semantic Web; Data quality management; Linked datum; RDF; SPARQL; SPIN; Data reduction",,,,,,,,"Wang, R.Y., Strong, D.M., Beyond accuracy: What data quality means to data consumers (1996) Journal of Management Information Systems, 12 (4), pp. 5-33; Redman, T.C., (2001) Data Quality: The Field Guide, , Digital Press, Boston; Redman, T.C., (1996) Data Quality for the Information Age, , Artech House, Boston; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The semantic web (2001) Scientific American, 284 (5), pp. 34-43; Uschold, M., Gruninger, M., Ontologies: Principles, methods, and applications (1996) The Knowledge Engineering Review, 11 (2), pp. 93-155; BestBuy Catalog in RDF, , http://products.semweb.bestbuy.com/sitemap.xml; Hepp, M., GoodRelations: An ontology for describing products and services offers on the web (2008) EKAW 2008, pp. 329-346. , Gangemi, A., Euzenat, J.

This paper presents the Silk - Link Discovery Framework, a tool for finding relationships between entities within different data sources. Data publishers can use Silk to set RDF links from their data sources to other data sources on the Web. Silk features a declarative language for specifying which types of RDF links should be discovered between data sources as well as which conditions entities must fulfill in order to be interlinked. Link conditions may be based on various similarity metrics and can take the graph around entities into account, which is addressed using a path-based selector language. Silk accesses data sources over the SPARQL protocol and can thus be used without having to replicate datasets locally.","Link discovery; Linked data; RDF; Record linkage; Similarity","Link Discovery; Linked datum; RDF; Record linkage; Similarity; Data handling; World Wide Web; Silk",,,,,,,,"Berners-Lee, T., Linked Data - Design Issues, , http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html; Bizer, C., Cyganiak, R., Heath, T., How to Publish Linked Data on the Web, , http://www4.wiwiss.fuberlin.de/bizer/pub/LinkedDataTutorial/; Zhong, J., Conceptual graph matching for semantic search (2002) The 2002 International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS2002), , Amsterdam, April; Elmagarmid, A.K., Ipeirotis, P.G., Verykios, V.S., Duplicate record detection: A survey (2007) IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 19 (1), pp. 1-16; Winkler, W., Overview of record linkage and current research directions (2006) Bureau of the Census Technical Report; Euzenat, J., Shvaiko, P., (2007) Ontology Matching, , Springer, Heidelberg; Raimond, Y., Sutton, C., Sandler, M., Automatic interlinking of music datasets on the semantic web (2008) Linked Data on the Web Workshop (LDOW2008); Hassanzadeh, O., A Declarative framework for semantic link discovery over relational data (2009) Poster at 18th World Wide Web Conference (WWW2009); Nikolov, A., Integration of semantically annotated data by the knofuss architecture (2008) 16th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management, pp. 265-274","Chemnitz University of Technology, Straße der Nationen 62, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany",,,,"WWW 2009 Workshop on Linked Data on the Web, LDOW 2009","20 April 2009 through 20 April 2009","Madrid",100976,16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861750648

Recording provenance information of RDF triples aggregated from different heterogeneous sources is crucial in order to effectively support trust mechanisms, digital rights and privacy policies. Managing provenance becomes even more important when we consider not only explicitly stated but also implicit triples (through RDFS inference rules) in conjunction with declarative languages for querying and updating RDF graphs.

Some other initiatives extend this with argumentation for declarative networking, where the behavior of a network component is specified using some high-level declarative language, with a software-based engine implementing the behavior based on that specification. Our Proactive Future Internet (PROFI) vision follows these initiatives targeting also the following two problems: interoperability of the network elements programmed by different organizations, and the need for flexible cooperation among network elements, including coordination, conflict resolution and even negotiation. To tackle these problems, PROFI intends utilization of semantic languages (RDF-based) for declarative specification of network elements' behavior, and application of software agents as engines for executing such specifications. PROFI technological concept is based on the UbiVERSE, a high-level multidisciplinary research vision towards the future global information society which is also described in this paper. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Behavior-based; Conflict Resolution; Declarative Languages; Future internet; Global information society; Multi-disciplinary research; Network element; Overlay architecture; Programmability; Semantic language; Software-based; Technological concept; Active networks; High level languages; Internet; Linguistics; Middleware; Query languages; Semantics; Software agents; Specifications; Network components",,,,,,,,"Chu, D., Popa, L., Tavakoli, A., Hellerstein, J., Levis, P., Shenker, S., The design and implementation of a declarative sensor network system (2007) Proc. 5th ACM Conference on Embedded networked Sensor Systems (Sen-Sys 2007), , Sydney, Australia; Active Networks, , http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/darpa-activenet, DARPA Research, Online; Declarative Networking, , http://p2.cs.berkeley.edu, EECS UC Berkeley Research, Online; Global Environment for Network Innovations, , http://geni.net, GENI, Online; Research Network of Laboratories Research Areas, , http://www.intel-research.net/research-areas.shtml, Online; Katasonov, A., Kaykova, O., Khriyenko, O., Nikitin, S., Terziyan, V., Smart semantic middleware for the internet of things (2008) Proc. 5th Intl.

In particular we summarize the Leibniz's position against Newton and Clarke on the nature of space-time, Penrose's model of spin networks, Heisenberg's fundamental equation for the unification of elementary particles, Finkelstein's space-time code, Weizsäcker's urs theory that unifies the postulates of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity, Sorkin's causal sets, Markopoulou's quantum causal histories, Markopoulou and Smolin's causal spin foams, in the last three of which the principle of causality has been introduced. In order to analyze the nature of space-time, we consider three levels of knowledge - observational, theoretical and ontological - to which the different models can be ascribed. Following similar approach to the models mentioned in the first sections, we present our theoretical model of the structure of the space-time, some physical applications and the ontological interpretation of the model. In order to implement the above models with theological aspects we present in the last sections two theologians, Pannenberg and Torrance, who have made explicit analysis of the nature of space-time from a relational point of view. Following their expositions we have presented, after some epistemological presuppositions, the connection between the Creation and the rationality of God through the structure of space-time and the communication of God to the creatures in the Incarnation through the same structure. © PENSAMIENTO.","Causal cubic lattice; Causal sets; Creation; god rationality; Incarnation; Quantum causal histories; Relational theory; Space-time; Space-time code; Spin foams; Spin networks; Urs theory",,,,,,,,,"Leibniz, Correspondence with Samuel Clarke, (4), pp. III. , letter; LEIBNIZ, «Correspondence with Samuel Clarke», V letter, n. 47; Leibniz, G.W., Initia rerum mathematicarum metaphysica (1962) Mathematische Schriften, 7, pp. 17-39. , C.

It covers four complementary areas: declarative semantics based on adaptations of mathematical logic, operational semantics, complexity and expressive power, and optimisation of query evaluation. The treatment of these areas is foundation-oriented, the foundations having resulted from over four decades of research in the logic programming and database communities on combinations of query languages and rules. These results have later formed the basis for conceiving, improving, and implementing several Web and Semantic Web technologies, in particular query languages such as XQuery or SPARQL for querying relational, XML, and RDF data, and rule languages like the ""Rule Interchange Framework (RIF)"" currently being developed in a working group of the W3C. Coverage of the article is deliberately limited to declarative languages in a classical setting: issues such as query answering in F-Logic or in description logics, or the relationship of query answering to reactive rules and events, are not addressed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,"Computational complexity; Formal logic; Logic programming; Query languages; Semantic Web; Semantics; Query answering; Query evaluation; Rule Interchange Framework; Query processing",,,,,,,,"Abiteboul, S., Beeri, C., The Power of Languages for the Manipulation of Complex Values (1995) VLDB Journal, 4 (4), pp. 727-794; Abiteboul, S., Hull, R., Vianu, V., (1995) Foundations of Databases, , Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.

Current efforts include the Extensible Markup Language XML, the Resource description Framework, Topic Maps and the DARPA Agent Markup Language DAML+OIL. A rich domain that requires special attention is the semantics of geospatial information. In order to approach the Semantic Geospatial Web, a mediation system for querying spatial and non-spatial information is presented in this paper. The spatial information is represented in the Geographical Markup Language (GML). GML is an XML encoding developed by the OpenGIS Consortium for the transport and storage of spatial/geographic information, including both spatial features and non-spatial features. In order to integrate spatial information from several spatial XML documents (GML), we have based our work on the Community Web Portal concept with RDF and RQL, a declarative language to query both RDF descriptions and related schemas. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Computational linguistics; Geographic information systems; Hypertext systems; Portals; Query languages; Web services; Websites; World Wide Web; XML; DARPA agent markup languages; Declarative Languages; Geo-spatial informations; Mediation systems; Open gis consortiums; Research communities; Resource description framework; Spatial informations; Semantic Web",,,,,,,,"Berners-Lee, J., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The Semantic Web (2001) Scientific American, 184 (5), pp. 34-43; Egenhofer, J., Toward the Semantic Geospatial Web.

Better knowledge about their meaning, usage, accessibility or quality will considerably facilitate an automated processing of Web resources. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) enables the creation and exchange of metadata as normal Web data. Although voluminous RDF descriptions are already appearing, sufficiently expressive declarative languages for querying both RDF descriptions and schemas are still missing. In this paper, we propose a new RDF query language called RQL. It is a typed functional language (a la OQL) and relies on a formal model for directed labeled graphs permitting the interpretation of superimposed resource descriptions by means of one or more RDF schemas. RQL adapts the functionality of semistructured/XML query languages to the peculiarities of RDF but, foremost, it enables to uniformly query both resource descriptions and schemas. We illustrate the RQL syntax, semantics and typing system by means of a set of example queries and report on the performance of our persistent RDF Store employed by the RQL interpreter.",,"Automated processing; Declarative Languages; Declarative query languages; E-marketplaces; Formal model; Functional languages; Knowledge portals; Labeled graphs; RDF query language; RDF schemas; Resource description; Resource description framework; Schemas; Semantic web applications; Still missing; Typing systems; Web content; Web data; Web resources; Linguistics; Metadata; Semantic Web; Semantics; World Wide Web; Query languages",,,,,,,,"Abiteboul, S., Buneman, P., Suciu, D., (1999) Data on the Web: From Relations to Semistructured Data and XML, , Morgan Kaufmann; Abiteboul, S., Cluet, S., Christophides, V., Milo, T., Moerkotte, G., Siméon, J., Querying Documents in Object Databases (1997) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 1 (1), pp. 5-18. , April; Abiteboul, S., Hull, R., Vianu, V., (1995) Foundations of Databases, , Addison-Wesley; Abiteboul, S., Quass, D., McHugh, J., Widom, J., Wiener, J., The Lorel Query Language for Semistructured Data (1997) International Journal on Digital Libraries, 1 (1), pp. 68-88. , April; Agrawal, R., Borgida, A., Jagadish, H.V., Efficient Management of Transitive Relationships in Large Data Bases (1989) SIGMOD'89, pp. 253-262. , Portland, Oregon, USA; Alexaki, S., Karvounarakis, G., Christophides, V., Plexousakis, D., Tolle, K., The ICS-FORTH RDFSuite: Managing Voluminous RDF Description Bases (2001) 2nd International Workshop on the Semantic Web, pp. 1-13. , Hong Kong, Available at 139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/publications/-semweb2001. pdf; Alexaki, S., Karvounarakis, G., Christophides, V., Plexousakis, D., Tolle, K., On Storing Voluminous RDF descriptions: The case of Web Portal Catalogs 4th International Workshop on the Web and Databases (WebDB), Santa Barbara, CA, 2001, , Available at 139.91.183.30:9090/RDF/publications/webdb2001.pdf; Amer-Yahia, S., Jagadish, H., Lakshmanan, L., Srivastava, D., On bounding-schemas for LDAP directories (2000) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 1777, pp. 287-301. , Proceedings of the International Conference on Extending Database Technology, Konstanz, Germany, March Springer; Beged-Dov, G., Brickley, D., Dornfest, R., Davis, I., Dodds, L., Eisenzopf, J., Galbraith, D., Van Der Vlist, E., (2000) Rich Site Summary Specification Protocol (RSS 1.0), , Internet Draft, August; Berners-Lee, T., Hendler, J., Lassila, O., The Semantic Web (2001) Scientific American, , May; Bray, T., Paoli, J., Sperberg-McQueen, C.M., (1998) Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0.
