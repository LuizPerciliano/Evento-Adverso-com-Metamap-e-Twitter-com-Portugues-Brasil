Since traditional post-marketing surveillance systems based on spontaneous reports have a serious underreporting issue, in recent years research on the detection of adverse reaction events using social media such as Twitter as a data source has attracted increasing attention in recent year. Deep learning models usually rely on a large number of training samples. However, due to the characteristics of user-generated content and the time-consuming data annotation process, related research is faced with the problems caused by small-scale annotated datasets, which restricts deep learning models in achieving satisfactory results. Accordingly, we introduce two regularization methods are introduced at the representation level, i.e., graph embedding-based data augmentation and adversarial training, to improve the performance of detecting adverse events under such conditions. Besides, the applicable scope of these two methods is analyzed and discussed through experiments. Combined with the convolutional neural network, this paper proposes an adverse drug event detection framework that can make full use of the methods. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",,2-s2.0-85103114472

However, existing studies usually only use word embeddings as the input for deep learning models, which ignores the structural information of sentences. In addition, deep learning models usually require a large number of cases for training, but the scale of annotated corpora that can be used for this task is limited. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a graph-boosted framework, that constructs the text into a graph structure. By using pre-trained graph embeddings and word embeddings for model training, our proposed framework provides richer semantic and structural information for prediction.

The purpose of this study is to identify the different text mining approaches used in different application areas of the biomedical domain, the common tools used and the challenges of biomedical text mining as compared to generic text mining algorithms. This study will be of value to biomedical researchers by allowing them to correlate text mining approaches to specific biomedical application areas. Implications for future research are also discussed. Design/methodology/approach: The review was conducted following the principles of the Kitchenham method. A number of research questions were first formulated, followed by the definition of the search strategy. The papers were then selected based on a list of assessment criteria. Each of the papers were analyzed and information relevant to the research questions were extracted. Findings: It was found that researchers have mostly harnessed data sources such as electronic health records, biomedical literature, social media and health-related forums. The most common text mining technique was natural language processing using tools such as MetaMap and Unstructured Information Management Architecture, alongside the use of medical terminologies such as Unified Medical Language System. The main application area was the detection of adverse drug events. Challenges identified included the need to deal with huge amounts of text, the heterogeneity of the different data sources, the duality of meaning of words in biomedical text and the amount of noise introduced mainly from social media and health-related forums. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, other reviews in this area have focused on either specific techniques, specific application areas or specific data sources. The results of this review will help researchers to correlate most relevant and recent advances in text mining approaches to specific biomedical application areas by providing an up-to-date and holistic view of work done in this research area. The use of emerging text mining techniques has great potential to spur the development of innovative applications, thus considerably impacting on the advancement of biomedical research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",,2-s2.0-85097937497

This allows for efficient social-media ADR detection with low training and re-training costs to adapt to the changes and emergence of informal medical laymen terms.

Social media, such as Twitter, has become a valuable online tool to describe the early detection of various adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Different medications have adverse effects on various cells and tissues, sometimes more than one cell population would be adversely affected. These types of side effect are occasionally associated with the direct or indirect influence of prescribed drugs but do not have general unfavorable mutagenic consequences on patients. This study aimed to demonstrate a quick and accurate method to collect and classify information based on the distribution of approved data on Twitter. Materials and Methods: In this classification method, we selected ""ask a patient"" dataset and combination of Twitter ""Ask a Patient"" datasets that comprised of 6,623, 26,934, and 11,623 reviews. We used deep learning methods with the word2vec to classify ADR comments posted by the users and present an architecture by HAN, FastText, and CNN. Results: Natural language processing (NLP) deep learning is able to address more advanced peculiarity in learning information compared to other types of machine learning. Moreover, the current study highlighted the advantage of incorporating various semantic features, including topics and concepts. Conclusion: Our approach predicts drug safety with the accuracy of 93% (the combination of Twitter and ""Ask a Patient"" datasets) in a binary manner. Despite the apparent benefit of various conventional classifiers, deep learning-based text classification methods seem to be precise and influential tools to detect ADR. © 2020 Royan Institute (ACECR).

However, when prescribing drugs, doctors must be conscious of all potential drug side effects. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, adverse drug events (ADEs), or harmful side effects, account for 1/3 of total hospital admissions each year. The goal of this research is to utilize novel deep learning methods for accurate detection and identification of professionally unreported drug side effects using widely available public data (open data). Utilizing a manually-labelled dataset of 10,000 reviews gathered from WebMD and Drugs.com, this research proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) based models for ADE detection and extraction and compares results to standard deep learning models and current state-of-the-art extraction models. By utilizing a hybrid of transfer learning from pre-trained BERT representations and sentence embeddings, the proposed model achieves an AUC score of 0.94 for ADE detection and an F1 score of 0.97 for ADE extraction. Previous state of the art deep learning approach achieves an AUC of 0.85 in ADE detection and an F1 of 0.82 in ADE extraction on our dataset of review texts. The results show that a BERT-based model achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the ADE detection and extraction task. This approach can be applied to multiple healthcare and information extraction tasks and used to help solve the problem that doctors face when prescribing drugs. Overall, this research introduces a novel dataset utilizing social media health forum data and shows the viability and capability of using deep learning techniques in ADE detection and extraction as well as information extraction as a whole.

Being able to identify Twitter posts of personal experience related to medication use is as important as being able to identify expressions of adverse medical events/reactions for the surveillance purpose. Identifying personal experience tweets is a challenging task, especially in the aspect of engineering features for classification. Word embedding has become a superior alternative to engineered features in many text classification applications. To investigate if word embedding-based methods can perform constantly better than conventional classification methods with engineered features, we assessed the classification performance of 4 word embedding techniques: GloVe, word2vec, fastText, and wordRank. Using a corpus of 22 million unlabeled tweets for learning of word embedding and a corpus of 12,331 annotated tweets for classification, we discovered that word embedding-based classification methods consistently outperform the engineered feature-based classification methods with statistical significance of p &lt; 0.01, but there exist no significantly statistical differences among the 4 study word embedding methods (p &lt; 0.05). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,2-s2.0-85070553364

A fundamental step toward incorporating Twitter data in pharmacoepidemiologic research is to automatically recognize medication mentions in tweets. Given that lexical searches for medication names suffer from low recall due to misspellings or ambiguity with common words, we propose a more advanced method to recognize them. Materials and Methods: We present Kusuri, an Ensemble Learning classifier able to identify tweets mentioning drug products and dietary supplements. Kusuri (""medication"" in Japanese) is composed of 2 modules: first, 4 different classifiers (lexicon based, spelling variant based, pattern based, and a weakly trained neural network) are applied in parallel to discover tweets potentially containing medication names; second, an ensemble of deep neural networks encoding morphological, semantic, and long-range dependencies of important words in the tweets makes the final decision. Results: On a class-balanced (50-50) corpus of 15 005 tweets, Kusuri demonstrated performances close to human annotators with an F1 score of 93.7%, the best score achieved thus far on this corpus. On a corpus made of all tweets posted by 112 Twitter users (98 959 tweets, with only 0.26% mentioning medications), Kusuri obtained an F1 score of 78.8%. To the best of our knowledge, Kusuri is the first system to achieve this score on such an extremely imbalanced dataset. Conclusions: The system identifies tweets mentioning drug names with performance high enough to ensure its usefulness, and is ready to be integrated in pharmacovigilance, toxicovigilance, or more generally, public health pipelines that depend on medication name mentions. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

The adoption of social media data has been hindered by the massive and noisy nature of the data. Initial attempts to use social media data have relied on exact text matches to drugs of interest, and therefore suffer from the gap between formal drug lexicons and the informal nature of social media. The Reddit comment archive represents an ideal corpus for bridging this gap. We trained a word embedding model, RedMed, to facilitate the identification and retrieval of health entities from Reddit data. We compare the performance of our model trained on a consumer-generated corpus against publicly available models trained on expert-generated corpora. Our automated classification pipeline achieves an accuracy of 0.88 and a specificity of >0.9 across four different term classes. Of all drug mentions, an average of 79% (±0.5%) were exact matches to a generic or trademark drug name, 14% (±0.5%) were misspellings, 6.4% (±0.3%) were synonyms, and 0.13% (±0.05%) were pill marks. We find that our system captures an additional 20% of mentions; these would have been missed by approaches that rely solely on exact string matches.

These tasks are a crucial step to many natural language understanding applications in the biomedical domain. Automatic medical coding of electronic medical records, automated summarizing of patient records, automatic cohort identification for clinical studies, text simplification of health documents for patients, early detection of adverse drug reactions or automatic identification of risk factors are only a few examples of the many possible opportunities that the text analysis can offer in the clinical domain. In this work, our efforts are primarily directed towards the improvement of the pharmacovigilance process by the automatic detection of drug-drug interactions (DDI) from texts. Moreover, we deal with the semantic analysis of texts containing health information for patients. Our two-stage approach is based on Deep Learning architectures. Concretely, NER is performed combining a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and a Conditional Random Field (CRF), while RE applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Since our approach uses very few language resources, only the pre-trained word embeddings, and does not exploit any domain resources (such as dictionaries or ontologies), this can be easily expandable to support other languages and clinical applications that require the exploitation of semantic information (concepts and relationships) from texts. During the last years, the task of DDI extraction has received great attention by the BioNLP community. However, the problem has been traditionally evaluated as two separate subtasks: drug name recognition and extraction of DDIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an evaluation of the whole pipeline.

These methods can be categorized by complexity and precision level. Co-occurrence-based ML methods are rather basic, as they identify simultaneous appearance of drugs and clinical events in a single post. In contrast, statistical learning methods involve more complex NLP and identify drugs, events, and associations between them. We aimed to compare the ability of co-occurrence and NLP to identify AEs and signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) in patient-generated SM. We also examined the performance of lift in SM-based signal detection (SD). Methods: Our examination was performed in a corpus of SM posts crawled from open online patient forums and communities, using the spontaneously reported VigiBase data as reference data set. Results: We found that co-occurrence and NLP produce AEs, which are 57% and 93% consistent with VigiBase AEs, respectively. Among the SDRs identified both in SM and in VigiBase, up to 55.3% were identified earlier in co-occurrence, and up to 32.1% were identified earlier in NLP-processed SM. Using lift in SM SD provided performance similar to frequentist methods, both in co-occurrence and in NLP-processed AEs. Conclusion: Our results indicate that using SM as a data source complementary to traditional pharmacovigilance sources should be considered further. Various levels of SM processing may be considered, depending on the preferred policies and tolerance for false-positive to false-negative balance in routine pharmacovigilance processes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","31392844",2-s2.0-85070501223

There is substantial previous research on ADRs extraction from English online forums. However, very limited research was done on Chinese data. In this paper, we try to use the posts from two popular Chinese social media as the original dataset. We propose a semi-supervised learning framework that detects mentions of medications and colloquial ADR terms and extracts lexicon-syntactic features from natural language text to recognize positive associations between drug use and ADRs. The key contribution is an automatic label generation algorithm, which requires very little manual annotation. This bootstrapping algorithm could also be further applied on English data.

Information technology solutions aiming at extracting adverse reactions (ADRs) from posts on health forums require a rigorous evaluation methodology if their results are to be used to make decisions. First, a gold standard, consisting of manual annotations of the ADR by human experts from the corpus extracted from social media, must be implemented and its quality must be assessed. Second, as for clinical research protocols, the sample size must rely on statistical arguments. Finally, the extraction methods must target the relation between the drug and the disease (which might be either treated or caused by the drug) rather than simple co-occurrences in the posts. Objective: We propose a standardized protocol for the evaluation of a software extracting ADRs from the messages on health forums. The study is conducted as part of the Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media project. Methods: Messages from French health forums were extracted. Entity recognition was based on Racine Pharma lexicon for drugs and Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terminology for potential adverse events (AEs). Natural language processing-based techniques automated the ADR information extraction (relation between the drug and AE entities). The corpus of evaluation was a random sample of the messages containing drugs and/or AE concepts corresponding to recent pharmacovigilance alerts. A total of 2 persons experienced in medical terminology manually annotated the corpus, thus creating the gold standard, according to an annotator guideline. We will evaluate our tool against the gold standard with recall, precision, and f-measure. Interannotator agreement, reflecting gold standard quality, will be evaluated with hierarchical kappa. Granularities in the terminologies will be further explored. Results: Necessary and sufficient sample size was calculated to ensure statistical confidence in the assessed results. As we expected a global recall of 0.5, we needed at least 384 identified ADR concepts to obtain a 95% CI with a total width of 0.10 around 0.5. The automated ADR information extraction in the corpus for evaluation is already finished. The 2 annotators already completed the annotation process. The analysis of the performance of the ADR information extraction module as compared with gold standard is ongoing. Conclusions: This protocol is based on the standardized statistical methods from clinical research to create the corpus, thus ensuring the necessary statistical power of the assessed results.

Objective: The goal of this study is to identify cutaneous ADR signals in social health networks and compare the frequency and timing of these ADRs to clinical reports in the literature. Methods: We present a natural language processing-based, ADR signal-generation pipeline based on patient posts on Internet social health networks. We identified user posts from the Inspire health forums related to two chemotherapy classes: erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, and nivolumab and pembrolizumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors. We extracted mentions of ADRs from unstructured content of patient posts. We then performed population-level association analyses and time-to-detection analyses. Results: Our system detected cutaneous ADRs from patient reports with high precision (0.90) and at frequencies comparable to those documented in the literature but an average of 7 months ahead of their literature reporting. Known ADRs were associated with higher proportional reporting ratios compared to negative controls, demonstrating the robustness of our analyses. Our named entity recognition system achieved a 0.738 microaveraged F-measure in detecting ADR entities, not limited to cutaneous ADRs, in health forum posts. Additionally, we discovered the novel ADR of hypohidrosis reported by 23 patients in erlotinib-related posts; this ADR was absent from 15 years of literature on this medication and we recently reported the finding in a clinical oncology journal. Conclusions: Several hundred million patients report health concerns in social health networks, yet this information is markedly underutilized for pharmacosurveillance. We demonstrated the ability of a natural language processing-based signal-generation pipeline to accurately detect patient reports of ADRs months in advance of literature reporting and the robustness of statistical analyses to validate system detections. Our findings suggest the important contributions that social health network data can play in contributing to more comprehensive and timely pharmacovigilance. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc.

We present a method based on a supervised regression approach leveraging medical concepts of different types and their mechanisms. The experiments on a collection of reviews demonstrate that features based on biomedical entities mentioned in reviews result in performance gains of up to 8% in mean squared error.

AE are health problems that can occur during treatment with a pharmaceutical product, which in the drug’s post-marketing period can require a significant increase in health care and result in unnecessary and often fatal harm to patients. Therefore, a key objective for the health system is to identify AE as soon as possible in the post-marketing period. Some countries have pharmacovigilance systems responsible for collecting voluntary reports of post-marketing AE, but studies have shown that social networks can be used to obtain more and faster reports. The current project’s main objective is to build a totally automated system using Twitter as a source to detect both new and previously known AE and conduct the statistical analysis of the resulting data. A system was thus built to collect, process, analyze, and assess tweets in search of AE, comparing them to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data and the reference standard. The results allowed detecting new and existing AE related to the drug doxycycline, showing that Twitter can be useful in pharmacovigilance when employed jointly with other data sources. © 2019, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

A typical setting is pharmacovigilance (PV). The manual detection of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in narrative reports is time consuming and natural language processing (NLP) provides a concrete help to PV experts. In this paper, we carry out experiments for testing performances of MagiCoder, an NLP application designed to extract MedDRA terms from narrative clinical text. Given a narrative description, MagiCoder proposes an automatic encoding. The pharmacologist reviews, (possibly) corrects, and then, validates the solution. This drastically reduces the time needed for the validation of reports with respect to a completely manual encoding. In previous work, we mainly tested MagiCoder performances on Italian written spontaneous reports. In this paper, we include some new features, change the experiment design, and carry on more tests about MagiCoder. Moreover, we do a change of language, moving to English documents.

The purpose of this study was to assess and compare perceptions about chemotherapy of patients and health-care providers through analysis of chemo-related tweets. Materials and methods: Cancer-related Twitter accounts and their tweets were obtained through using Tweepy (Python library). Multiple text classification algorithms were tested to identify the models with best performance in classifying the accounts into individual and organization. Chemotherapy-specific tweets were extracted from historical tweetset, and the content of these tweets was analyzed using topic model, sentiment analysis and word co-occurrence network. Results: Using the description in Twitter users’ profiles, the accounts related with cancer were collected and coded as individual or organization. We employed Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network with GloVe word embeddings to identify the user into individuals and organizations with accuracy of 85.2%. 13, 273 and 14,051 publicly available chemotherapy-related tweets were retrieved from individuals and organizations, respectively. The content of the chemo-related tweets was analyzed by text mining approaches. The tweets from individual accounts pertained to personal chemotherapy experience and emotions. In contrast with the personal users, professional accounts had a higher proportion of neutral tweets about side effects. The information about the assessment of response to chemotherapy was deficient from organizations on Twitter. Discussion: Examining chemotherapy discussions on Twitter provide new lens into content and behavioral patterns associated with treatments for cancer patients. The methodology described herein allowed us to collect relatively large number of health-related tweets over a greater time period and exploit the potential power of social media, which provide comprehensive view on patients’ perceptions of chemotherapy.

An additional objective was to publicly release manually annotated data. Materials and Methods We organized 3 independent subtasks: Automatic classification of self-reports of 1) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 2) medication consumption, from medication-mentioning tweets, and 3) normalization of ADR expressions. Training data consisted of 15 717 annotated tweets for (1), 10 260 for (2), and 6650 ADR phrases and identifiers for (3); and exhibited typical properties of social-media-based health-related texts. Systems were evaluated using 9961, 7513, and 2500 instances for the 3 subtasks, respectively. We evaluated performances of classes of methods and ensembles of system combinations following the shared tasks. Results Among 55 system runs, the best system scores for the 3 subtasks were 0.435 (ADR class F 1-score) for subtask-1, 0.693 (micro-Averaged F 1-score over two classes) for subtask-2, and 88.5% (accuracy) for subtask-3. Ensembles of system combinations obtained best scores of 0.476, 0.702, and 88.7%, outperforming individual systems. Discussion Among individual systems, support vector machines and convolutional neural networks showed high performance. Performance gains achieved by ensembles of system combinations suggest that such strategies may be suitable for operational systems relying on difficult text classification tasks (eg, subtask-1).

Recently, it has gained prominence due to the increasing amount of data suggesting that a large amount of patient harm is preventable and can be mitigated with effective risk strategies that have not been sufficiently adopted. Adverse events from medications are part of clinical practice, but the ability to identify a patient's risk and to minimize that risk must be a priority. The ability to identify adverse events has been a challenge due to limitations of available data sources, which are often free text. The use of natural language processing (NLP) may help to address these limitations. NLP is the artificial intelligence domain of computer science that uses computers to manipulate unstructured data (i.e., narrative text or speech data) in the context of a specific task. In this narrative review, we illustrate the fundamentals of NLP and discuss NLP's application to medication safety in four data sources: electronic health records, Internet-based data, published literature, and reporting systems. Given the magnitude of available data from these sources, a growing area is the use of computer algorithms to help automatically detect associations between medications and adverse effects. The main benefit of NLP is in the time savings associated with automation of various medication safety tasks such as the medication reconciliation process facilitated by computers, as well as the potential for near–real-time identification of adverse events for postmarketing surveillance such as those posted on social media that would otherwise go unanalyzed. NLP is limited by a lack of data sharing between health care organizations due to insufficient interoperability capabilities, inhibiting large-scale adverse event monitoring across populations. We anticipate that future work in this area will focus on the integration of data sources from different domains to improve the ability to identify potential adverse events more quickly and to improve clinical decision support with regard to a patient's estimated risk for specific adverse events at the time of medication prescription or review. © 2018 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.","29884988",2-s2.0-85050472230

Data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, content summarization and natural language processing techniques are often used in this field with promising results. However, there are still several difficulties concerning the extraction, as the highly domain-specific vocabulary presents a few challenges. This is mainly because patients like to use idiomatic or vernacular expressions along with descriptive symptom explanations, which tend to deviate from grammatical rules or expected terms. To address this issue, we propose a well-curated baseline. We believe that building a specific lexicon, identifying common linguistic patterns and observing certain phrasal structures is key to first understanding how a user generates contents online. From there, we can later develop sets of tailored rules that will allow data classification/extraction systems to potentially improve their efficiency at these tasks. © 2018 IEEE.",,2-s2.0-85050993601

Objective: Our objective in the ADR-PRISM project was to provide text mining and visualization tools to explore a corpus of posts extracted from social media. We evaluated this approach on a corpus of 21 million posts from five patient forums, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the data available on methylphenidate in this corpus. Methods: We applied text mining methods based on named entity recognition and relation extraction in the corpus, followed by signal detection using proportional reporting ratio (PRR). We also used topic modeling based on the Correlated Topic Model to obtain the list of the matics in the corpus and classify the messages based on their topics. Results: We automatically identified 3443 posts about methylphenidate published between 2007 and 2016, among which 61 adverse drug reactions (ADR) were automatically detected. Two pharmacovigilance experts evaluated manually the quality of automatic identification, and a f-measure of 0.57 was reached. Patient's reports were mainly neuro-psychiatric effects. Applying PRR, 67% of the ADRs were signals, including most of the neuro-psychiatric symptoms but also palpitations. Topic modeling showed that the most represented topics were related to Childhood and Treatment initiation, but also Side effects. Cases of misuse were also identified in this corpus, including recreational use and abuse. Conclusion: Named entity recognition combined with signal detection and topic modeling have demonstrated their complementarity in mining social media data. An in-depth analysis focused on methylphenidate showed that this approach was able to detect potential signals and to provide better understanding of patients' behaviors regarding drugs, including misuse. © 2018 Chen, Faviez, Schuck, Lillo-Le-Louët, Texier, Dahamna, Huot, Foulquié, Pereira, Leroux, Karapetiantz, Guenegou-Arnoux, Katsahian, Bousquet and Burgun.",,2-s2.0-85047570388

In medical applications, demographic information regarding the authors of these reviews such as age and gender is of primary importance; however, existing studies usually either assume that this information is available or overlook the issue entirely.

Despite its popularity, it is not always clear what big data refers to exactly. Big data has become a very popular topic in healthcare, where the term primarily refers to the vast and growing volumes of computerized medical information available in the form of electronic health records, administrative or health claims data, disease and drug monitoring registries and so on. This kind of data is generally collected routinely during administrative processes and clinical practice by different healthcare professionals: from doctors recording their patients’ medical history, drug prescriptions or medical claims to pharmacists registering dispensed prescriptions. For a long time, this data accumulated without its value being fully recognized and leveraged. Today big data has an important place in healthcare, including in pharmacovigilance. The expanding role of big data in pharmacovigilance includes signal detection, substantiation and validation of drug or vaccine safety signals, and increasingly new sources of information such as social media are also being considered. The aim of the present paper is to discuss the uses of big data for drug safety post-marketing assessment. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","28840504",2-s2.0-85028353382

In particular, new drug pharmacological properties can be derived patient observations shared in social media forums. Developing approaches designed to automatically retrieve this information is of no low interest for personalized medicine and wide-scale drug tests. The full potential of the effective exploitation of both textual data and published biological data for drug research often goes untapped mostly because of the lack of tools and focused methodologies to curate and integrate the data and transform it into new, experimentally testable hypotheses. Deep learning architectures have shown promising results for a wide range of tasks. In this work, we propose to address a challenging problem by applying modern deep neural networks for disease named entity recognition. An essential step for this task is recognition of disease mentions and medical concept nor-malization, which is highly difficult with simple string matching approaches. We cast the task as an end-to-end problem, solved using two architectures based on recurrent neural networks and pre-trained word embeddings. We show that it is possible to assess the practicability of using social media data to extract representative medical concepts for pharmacovigilance or drug repurposing. © 2017 IEEE.",,2-s2.0-85047745771

In general, the ADR detection process consists of 4 steps: (1) data collection from social media; (2) classification/filtering of ADR assertive text segments; (3) extraction of ADR mentions from text segments; (4) analysis of extracted ADR mentions for signal generation. The implementation of each step in the Russian-language environment is associated with a number of difficulties in comparison with the traditional English-speaking environment. First of all, they are connected with the lack of necessary databases and specialized language resources. In addition, an important negative role is played by the complex grammatical structure of the Russian language. The authors present various methods of machine learning algorithms adaptation in order to overcome these difficulties. For step 3 on the material of Russian-language text forums using the ensemble classifier, the Accuracy = 0.805 was obtained. For step 4 on the material of Russian-language EHR, by adapting pyConTextNLP, the F-measure = 0.935 was obtained, and by adapting ConText algorithm, the F-measure = 0.92–0.95 was obtained.

Medical professionals have a difficult time collecting this information. It is anticipated that social media could help to collect this data and track side effects. Twitter data can be used for this task given that users post their personal health related experiences on-line. One problem with Twitter data, however, is that it contains a lot of noise. Therefore, an approach is needed to remove the noise.

In recent years, increasing numbers of scientific articles and health-related social media posts have been generated and shared daily, albeit with very limited use for ADE study and with little known about the content with respect to ADEs. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a big data analytics strategy that mines the content of scientific articles and health-related Web-based social media to detect and identify ADEs. Methods: We analyzed the following two data sources: (1) biomedical articles and (2) health-related social media blog posts. We developed an intelligent and scalable text mining solution on big data infrastructures composed of Apache Spark, natural language processing, and machine learning. This was combined with an Elasticsearch No-SQL distributed database to explore and visualize ADEs. Results: The accuracy, precision, recall, and area under receiver operating characteristic of the system were 92.7%, 93.6%, 93.0%, and 0.905, respectively, and showed better results in comparison with traditional approaches in the literature.

Classical Pharmacovigilance process is limited by underreporting which justifies the current interest in new knowledge sources such as social media. The Adverse Drug Reactions from Patient Reports in Social Media (ADR-PRISM) project aims to extract ADRs reported by patients in these media. We identified 5 major challenges to overcome to operationalize the analysis of patient posts: (1) variable quality of information on social media, (2) guarantee of data privacy, (3) response to pharmacovigilance expert expectations, (4) identification of relevant information within Web pages, and (5) robust and evolutive architecture. Objective: This article aims to describe the current state of advancement of the ADR-PRISM project by focusing on the solutions we have chosen to address these 5 major challenges. Methods: In this article, we propose methods and describe the advancement of this project on several aspects: (1) a quality driven approach for selecting relevant social media for the extraction of knowledge on potential ADRs, (2) an assessment of ethical issues and French regulation for the analysis of data on social media, (3) an analysis of pharmacovigilance expert requirements when reviewing patient posts on the Internet, (4) an extraction method based on natural language processing, pattern based matching, and selection of relevant medical concepts in reference terminologies, and (5) specifications of a component-based architecture for the monitoring system. Results: Considering the 5 major challenges, we (1) selected a set of 21 validated criteria for selecting social media to support the extraction of potential ADRs, (2) proposed solutions to guarantee data privacy of patients posting on Internet, (3) took into account pharmacovigilance expert requirements with use case diagrams and scenarios, (4) built domain-specific knowledge resources embeding a lexicon, morphological rules, context rules, semantic rules, syntactic rules, and post-analysis processing, and (5) proposed a component-based architecture that allows storage of big data and accessibility to third-party applications through Web services. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a component-based architecture that allows collection of patient posts on the Internet, near real-time processing of those posts including annotation, and storage in big data structures. In the next steps, we will evaluate the posts identified by the system in social media to clarify the interest and relevance of such approach to improve conventional pharmacovigilance processes based on spontaneous reporting. © Cedric Bousquet, Badisse Dahamna, Sylvie Guillemin-Lanne, Stefan J Darmoni, Carole Faviez, Charles Huot, Sandrine Katsahian, Vincent Leroux, Suzanne Pereira, Christophe Richard, Stéphane Schück, Julien Souvignet, Agnès Lillo-Le Louët, Nathalie Texier.

To find a larger sample of reports, a possible way is to mine online social media. With its current widespread use, social media such as Twitter has given rise to massive amounts of data, which can be used as reports for drug side effects. To process these large datasets, Apache Spark has become popular for fast, distributed batch processing. In this work, we have improved on previous pipelines in sentimental analysis-based mining, processing, and extracting tweets with drug-caused side effects. We have also added a new ensemble classifier using a combination of sentiment analysis features to increase the accuracy of identifying drug-caused side effects. In addition, the frequency count for the side effects is also provided. Furthermore, we have also implemented the same pipeline in Apache Spark to improve the speed of processing of tweets by 2.5 times, as well as to support the process of large tweet datasets. As the frequency count of drug side effects opens a wide door for further analysis, we present a preliminary study on this issue, including the side effects of simultaneously using two drugs, and the potential danger of using less-common combination of drugs. We believe the pipeline design and the results present in this work would have great implication on studying drug side effects and on big data analysis in general. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",,2-s2.0-85040256180

Human review of social media data is infeasible due to data quantity, thus natural language processing techniques are necessary. Social media includes informal vocabulary and irregular grammar, which challenge natural language processing methods. Our objective is to develop a scalable, deep-learning approach that exceeds state-of-the-art ADR detection performance in social media. Materials and Methods: We developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that labels words in an input sequence with ADR membership tags. The only input features are word-embedding vectors, which can be formed through task-independent pretraining or during ADR detection training. Results: Our best-performing RNN model used pretrained word embeddings created from a large, non- domain-specific Twitter dataset. It achieved an approximate match F-measure of 0.755 for ADR identification on the dataset, compared to 0.631 for a baseline lexicon system and 0.65 for the state-of-the-art conditional random field model. Feature analysis indicated that semantic information in pretrained word embeddings boosted sensitivity and, combined with contextual awareness captured in the RNN, precision. Discussion: Our model required no task-specific feature engineering, suggesting generalizability to additional sequence-labeling tasks. Learning curve analysis showed that our model reached optimal performance with fewer training examples than the other models. Conclusion: ADR detection performance in social media is significantly improved by using a contextually aware model and word embeddings formed from large, unlabeled datasets. The approach reduces manual datalabeling requirements and is scalable to large social media datasets. © The Author 2017.

Here, we used social media data to examine IBD patients' understanding of the risks and benefits associated with biologic therapies and how this affects decision-making. Methods: We collected posts from Twitter and e-forum discussions from >3000 social media sites posted between June 27, 2012 and June 27, 2015. Guided by natural language processing, we identified posts with specific IBD keywords that discussed the risks and/or benefits of biologics. We then manually coded the resulting posts and performed qualitative analysis using ATLAS.ti software. A hierarchical coding structure was developed based on the keyword list and relevant themes were identified through manual coding. Results: We examined 1598 IBD-related posts, of which 452 (28.3%) centered on the risks and/or benefits of biologics. There were 5 main themes: negative experiences and concerns with biologics (n = 247; 54.6%), decision-making surrounding biologic use (n = 169; 37.4%), positive experiences with biologics (n = 168; 37.2%), information seeking from peers (n = 125; 27.7%), and cost (n = 38; 8.4%). Posts describing negative experiences primarily commented on side effects from biologics, concerns about potential side effects and increased cancer risk, and pregnancy safety concerns. Posts on decision-making focused on nonbiologic treatment options, hesitation to initiate biologics, and concerns about changing or discontinuing regimens. Conclusions: Social media reveals a wide range of themes governing patients' experience and choice with IBD biologics. The complexity of navigating their risk-benefit profiles suggests merit in creating online tailored decision tools to support IBD patients' decision-making with biologic therapies.

Methodologies are needed for evaluating, quantitatively measuring and comparing the ability of these various approaches to accurately discover ADEs. This work is motivated by the observation that text sources such as the Medline/Medinfo library provide a wealth of information on human health. Unfortunately, ADEs often result from unexpected interactions, and the connection between conditions and drugs is not explicit in these sources.

Automatic extraction of ADR information can be crucial for healthcare providers, drug manufacturers, and consumers. However, because of the non-standard nature of social media language, automatically extracted ADR mentions need to be mapped to standard forms before they can be used by operational pharmacovigilance systems. We propose a modular natural language processing pipeline for mapping (normalizing) colloquial mentions of ADRs to their corresponding standardized identifiers. We seek to accomplish this task and enable customization of the pipeline so that distinct unlabeled free text resources can be incorporated to use the system for other normalization tasks. Our approach, which we call Hybrid Semantic Analysis (HSA), sequentially employs rule-based and semantic matching algorithms for mapping user-generated mentions to concept IDs in the Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. The semantic matching component of HSA is adaptive in nature and uses a regression model to combine various measures of semantic relatedness and resources to optimize normalization performance on the selected data source. On a publicly available corpus, our normalization method achieves 0.502 recall and 0.823 precision (F-measure: 0.624).

Extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) from social media provides a promising direction to addressing this challenging task. Prior studies typically perform lexicon-based extraction using existing dictionaries or medical lexicons. While those approaches can capture ADEs and identify risky drugs from patient social media postings, they often fail to detect those ADEs whose descriptive words do not exist in medical lexicons and dictionaries. In addition, their performance is inferior when ADE related social media content is expressed in an ambiguous manner. In this research, we propose a research framework using advanced natural language processing and deep learning for high-performance ADE extraction. The framework consists of training the word embeddings using a large medical domain corpus to capture precise semantic and syntactic word relationships, and a deep learning based named entity recognition method for drug and ADE entity identification and prediction. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms existing models when extracting ADEs from social media in different test beds. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",,2-s2.0-85033490328

Traditionally, the evaluation of nonmedical use has focused on controlled substances with addiction risk. Currently, there is no effective means of evaluating the nonmedical use of noncontrolled antidepressants. Objective: Social listening, in the context of public health sometimes called infodemiology or infoveillance, is the process of identifying and assessing what is being said about a company, product, brand, or individual, within forms of electronic interactive media. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine whether content analysis of social listening data could be utilized to identify posts discussing potential misuse or nonmedical use of bupropion and two comparators, amitriptyline and venlafaxine, and (2) to describe and characterize these posts. Methods: Social listening was performed on all publicly available posts cumulative through July 29, 2015, from two harm-reduction Web forums, Bluelight and Opiophile, which mentioned the study drugs. The acquired data were stripped of personally identifiable identification (PII). A set of generic, brand, and vernacular product names was used to identify product references in posts. Posts were obtained using natural language processing tools to identify vernacular references to drug misuse-related Preferred Terms from the English Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18 terminology. Posts were reviewed manually by coders, who extracted relevant details. Results: A total of 7756 references to at least one of the study antidepressants were identified within posts gathered for this study. Of these posts, 668 (8.61%, 668/7756) referenced misuse or nonmedical use of the drug, with bupropion accounting for 438 (65.6%, 438/668). Of the 668 posts, nonmedical use was discouraged by 40.6% (178/438), 22% (22/100), and 18.5% (24/130) and encouraged by 12.3% (54/438), 10% (10/100), and 10.8% (14/130) for bupropion, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine, respectively. The most commonly reported desired effects were similar to stimulants with bupropion, sedatives with amitriptyline, and dissociatives with venlafaxine. The nasal route of administration was most frequently reported for bupropion, whereas the oral route was most frequently reported for amitriptyline and venlafaxine. Bupropion and venlafaxine were most commonly procured from health care providers, whereas amitriptyline was most commonly obtained or stolen from a third party. The Fleiss kappa for interrater agreement among 20 items with 7 categorical response options evaluated by all 11 raters was 0.448 (95% CI 0.421-0.457). Conclusions: Social listening, conducted in collaboration with harm-reduction Web forums, offers a valuable new data source that can be used for monitoring nonmedical use of antidepressants. Additional work on the capabilities of social listening will help further delineate the benefits and limitations of this rapidly evolving data source. © Laurie S Anderson, Heidi G Bell, Michael Gilbert, Julie E Davidson, Christina Winter, Monica J Barratt, Beta Win, Jeffery L Painter, Christopher Menone, Jonathan Sayegh, Nabarun Dasgupta.

As a result, it becomes a great challenge to detect the potential adverse drug reactions before and after putting drugs into the market. With the development of the Internet, health-related social networks have accumulated large amounts of users’ comments on drugs, which may contribute to detect the adverse drug reactions. To this end, we propose a novel framework to detect potential adverse drug reactions based on healthrelated social networks. In our framework, we first extract mentions of diseases and adverse drug reactions from users’ comments using conditional random fields with different levels of features, and then filter the indications of drugs and known adverse drug reactions by external biomedical resources to obtain the potential adverse drug reactions. On the basis, we propose a modified Skip-gram model to discover associated proteins of potential adverse drug reactions, which will facilitate the biomedical experts to determine the authenticity of the potential adverse reactions. Extensive experiments based on DailyStrength show that our framework is effective for detecting potential adverse drug reactions from users’ comments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,2-s2.0-85003953024

Based on the intuition that patients post about Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) expressing negative sentiments, we investigate the effect of sentiment analysis features in locating ADR mentions. Methods We enrich the feature space of a state-of-the-art ADR identification method with sentiment analysis features. Using a corpus of posts from the DailyStrength forum and tweets annotated for ADR and indication mentions, we evaluate the extent to which sentiment analysis features help in locating ADR mentions and distinguishing them from indication mentions. Results Evaluation results show that sentiment analysis features marginally improve ADR identification in tweets and health related forum posts. Adding sentiment analysis features achieved a statistically significant F-measure increase from 72.14% to 73.22% in the Twitter part of an existing corpus using its original train/test split. Using stratified 10 × 10-fold cross-validation, statistically significant F-measure increases were shown in the DailyStrength part of the corpus, from 79.57% to 80.14%, and in the Twitter part of the corpus, from 66.91% to 69.16%. Moreover, sentiment analysis features are shown to reduce the number of ADRs being recognized as indications. Conclusion This study shows that adding sentiment analysis features can marginally improve the performance of even a state-of-the-art ADR identification method.

Existing systems for monitoring adverse drug events, such as the Federal Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) in the US, have shown limited effectiveness due to the lack of incentives for healthcare professionals and patients. While social media present opportunities to mine information about adverse events in near real-time, there are still important questions to be answered in order to understand their impact on pharmacovigilance. First, it is not known how many relevant social media posts occur per day on platforms like Twitter, i.e., whether there is “enough signal” for a post-market pharmacovigilance program based on Twitter mining. Second, it is not known what other topics are discussed by users in posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. In this paper, we outline how social media can be used as a human sensor for drug use monitoring. We introduce a large-scale, near real-time system for computational pharmacovigilance, and use our system to estimate the order of magnitude of the volume of daily self-reported pharmaceutical drug side effect tweets. The processing pipeline comprises a set of cascaded filters, followed by a supervised machine learning classifier. The cascaded filters quickly reduce the volume to a manageable sub-stream, from which a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier identifies adverse events based on a rich set of features taking into account surface-textual properties, as well as domain knowledge about drugs, side effects and the Twitter medium. Using a dataset of 10,000 manually annotated tweets, a SVM classifier achieves F1=60.4% and AUC=0.894. The yield of the classifier for a drug universe comprising 2,600 keywords is 721 tweets per day. We also investigate what other topics are discussed in the posts mentioning pharmaceutical drugs. We conclude by suggesting an ecosystem where regulators and pharmaceutical companies utilize social media to obtain feedback about consequences of pharmaceutical drug use. © Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

With the development of Web 2.0, social media has become a large data source for information on ADEs. The objective of this study is to develop a relation extraction system that uses natural language processing techniques to effectively distinguish between ADEs and non-ADEs in informal text on social media. Methods and materials: We develop a feature-based approach that utilizes various lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Information-gain-based feature selection is performed to address high-dimensional features. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of four well-known kernel-based approaches (i.e., subset tree kernel, tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and all-paths graph kernel) and several ensembles that are generated by adopting different combination methods (i.e., majority voting, weighted averaging, and stacked generalization). All of the approaches are tested using three data sets: two health-related discussion forums and one general social networking site (i.e., Twitter). Results: When investigating the contribution of each feature subset, the feature-based approach attains the best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) values, which are 78.6%, 72.2%, and 79.2% on the three data sets. When individual methods are used, we attain the best AUC values of 82.1%, 73.2%, and 77.0% using the subset tree kernel, shortest dependency path kernel, and feature-based approach on the three data sets, respectively. When using classifier ensembles, we achieve the best AUC values of 84.5%, 77.3%, and 84.5% on the three data sets, outperforming the baselines. Conclusions: Our experimental results indicate that ADE extraction from social media can benefit from feature selection. With respect to the effectiveness of different feature subsets, lexical features and semantic features can enhance the ADE extraction capability. Kernel-based approaches, which can stay away from the feature sparsity issue, are qualified to address the ADE extraction problem. Combining different individual classifiers using suitable combination methods can further enhance the ADE extraction effectiveness. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","27431037",2-s2.0-84974786922

Limitations of these data sources include potential under-reporting, lack of geographic diversity, and time lag between event occurrence and discovery. There is growing interest in exploring the use of social media (‘social listening’) to supplement established approaches for pharmacovigilance. Although social listening is commonly used for commercial purposes, there are only anecdotal reports of its use in pharmacovigilance. Health information posted online by patients is often publicly available, representing an untapped source of post-marketing safety data that could supplement data from existing sources. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to describe one methodology that could help unlock the potential of social media for safety surveillance. Methods: A third-party vendor acquired 24 months of publicly available Facebook and Twitter data, then processed the data by standardizing drug names and vernacular symptoms, removing duplicates and noise, masking personally identifiable information, and adding supplemental data to facilitate the review process. The resulting dataset was analyzed for safety and benefit information. Results: In Twitter, a total of 6,441,679 Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms (PTs) representing 702 individual PTs were discussed in the same post as a drug compared with 15,650,108 total PTs representing 946 individual PTs in Facebook. Further analysis revealed that 26 % of posts also contained benefit information. Conclusion: Social media listening is an important tool to augment post-marketing safety surveillance.

In this study, we developed a named entity recognition (NER) system based on conditional random fields to identify ADRs-related information from Twitter data. The representation of words for the input text is one of the crucial steps in supervised learning. Recently, the word vector representation is becoming popular, which uses unlabeled data to provide a generalization for reducing the data sparsity in word representation. This study examines different word representation methods for the ADR recognition task, including token normalization, and two state-of-the-art word embedding methods, namely word2vec and the global vectors (GloVe). The experimental results demonstrate that all of the studied representation scheme can improve the recall rate and overall F-measure with the cost of the reduced precision.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring supplements and ensuring that supplements are safe. However, current surveillance protocols are not always effective. Leveraging user-generated textual data, in the form of Amazon.com reviews for nutritional supplements, we use natural language processing techniques to develop a system for the monitoring of dietary sup- plements. We use topic modeling techniques, specifically a variation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and background knowledge in the form of an adverse reaction dictionary to score products based on their potential danger to the public. Our approach generates topics that semantically cap- ture adverse reactions from a document set consisting of reviews posted by users of specific products, and based on these topics, we propose a scoring mechanism to categorize products as “high potential danger”, “average potential danger” and “low potential danger.” We evaluate our system by com- paring the system categorization with human annotators, and we find that the our system agrees with the annotators 69.4% of the time. With these results, we demonstrate that our methods show promise and that our system represents a proof of concept as a viable low-cost, active approach for dietary supplement monitoring. © 2016, World Scientific Publishing Co.

The promise of social media has been realized by the public health domain, and recent research has addressed some important challenges in that domain by utilizing social media data. Tasks such as monitoring u trends, viral disease outbreaks, medication abuse, and adverse drug reactions are some examples of studies where data from social media have been exploited. The focus of this workshop is to explore solutions to three important natural language processing challenges for domain-specific social media text: (i) text classification, (ii) information extraction, and (iii) concept normalization. To explore different approaches to solving these problems on social media data, we designed a shared task which was open to participants globally. We designed three tasks using our in-house annotated Twitter data on adverse drug reactions. Task 1 involved automatic classification of adverse drug reaction assertive user posts; Task 2 focused on extracting specific adverse drug reaction mentions from user posts; and Task 3, which was slightly ill-defined due to the complex nature of the problem, involved normalizing user mentions of adverse drug reactions to standardized concept IDs. A total of 11 teams participated, and a total of 24 (18 for Task 1, and 6 for Task 2) system runs were submitted. Following the evaluation of the systems, and an assessment of their innovation/novelty, we accepted 7 descriptive manuscripts for publication - 5 for Task 1 and 2 for Task 2.

Objectives Our objective was to compare electronic health record data and social media data to better understand differences and similarities between clinician-reported ADRs and patients’ concerns regarding aspirin and atorvastatin. Methods This pilot study explored a large repository of electronic health record data and social media data for clinician-reported ADRs and patients concerns for two common medications: aspirin (n = 31,817 ADRs accessible in clinical data; n = 19,186 potential ADRs accessible in social media data) and atorvastatin (n = 15,047 ADRs accessible in clinical data; n = 23,408 potential ADRs accessible in social media data). Results We found that the most frequently reported ADRs matched the most frequent patients’ concerns. However, several less frequently reported reactions were more prevalent on social media (i.e., aspirin-induced hypoglycemia was discussed only on social media). Overall, we found a relatively strong positive and statistically significant correlation between the frequency ranking of reactions and patients’ concerns for atorvastatin (Pearson’s r = 0.61, p<0.001) but not for aspirin (Pearson’s r = 0.1, p = 0.69).

Efficient strategies for the extraction of information about ADRs from free text sources are essential to support the important task of detecting and classifying unexpected pathologies, possibly related to (therapy-related) drug use. Narrative ADR descriptions may be collected in different ways, e.g., Either by monitoring social networks or through the so called 'spontaneous reporting, the main method pharmacovigilance adopts in order to identify ADRs. The encoding of free-text ADR descriptions according to MedDRA standard terminology is central for report analysis. It is a complex work, which has to be manually implemented by the pharmacovigilance experts. The manual encoding is expensive (in terms of time). Moreover, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur, since the number of reports is growing up day by day. In this paper, we propose Magi Coder, an efficient Natural Language Processing algorithm able to automatically derive MedDRA terminologies from free text ADR descriptions. Magi Coder is part of Vigi Work, a web application for online ADR reporting and analysis. From a practical point of view, Magi Coder reduces the encoding time of ADR reports. Pharmacologists have simply to review and validate the MedDRA terms proposed by Magi Coder, instead of choosing the right terms among the 70K terms of MedDRA. Such improvement in the efficiency of pharmacologists' work has a relevant impact also on the quality of the following data analysis. Our proposal is based on a general approach, not depending on the considered language. Indeed, we developed Magi Coder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but preliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary changes. © 2015 IEEE.",,2-s2.0-84966269132

In this study, we develop a research framework with advanced natural language processing techniques for integrated and high-performance patient reported adverse drug event extraction. The framework consists of medical entity extraction for recognizing patient discussions of drug and events, adverse drug event extraction with shortest dependency path kernel based statistical learning method and semantic filtering with information from medical knowledge bases, and report source classification to tease out noise. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments were conducted on a test bed encompassing about postings from major diabetes and heart disease forums in the United States.

Outside traditional surveys, little is known about the opioid-induced constipation (OIC) patient experience and its impact on pain management. The purpose of this study was to use data from social media platforms to qualitatively examine patient beliefs about OIC and other prominent GI side effects, their impact on effective pain management and doctor-patient interaction. The authors collected Tweets from March 25 to July 31, 2014, and e-forum posts from health-related social networking sites regardless of timestamp. The authors identified specific keywords related to opioids and GI side effects to locate relevant content in the dataset, which was then manually coded using ATLAS.ti software. The authors examined 2,519,868 Tweets and more than 1.8 billion e-forum posts, of which, 88,586 Tweets and 9,767 posts satisfied the search criteria. Three thousand three individuals experienced opioidinduced GI side effects, mostly related to phenanthrenes (n = 1,589), and 1,274 (42.4 percent) individuals described constipation. Over-the-counter medications and nonevidence-based natural approaches were most commonly used to alleviate constipation. Many individuals questioned, rotated, reduced, or stopped their opioid treatments as a result of their GI side effects. Investigation of social media reveals a struggle to balance pain management with opioid-induced GI side effects, especially constipation. Individuals are often unprepared to treat OIC, to modify opioid regiments without medical advice, and to resort to using natural remedies and treatments lacking scientific evidence of effectiveness.

Major drug agencies have devoted a great interest in the early detection of ADRs due to their high incidence and increasing health care costs. Reporting systems are available in order for both healthcare professionals and patients to alert about possible ADRs. However, several studies have shown that these adverse events are underestimated. Our hypothesis is that health social networks could be a significant information source for the early detection of ADRs as well as of new drug indications. Methods: In this work we present a system for detecting drug effects (which include both adverse drug reactions as well as drug indications) from user posts extracted from a Spanish health forum. Texts were processed using MeaningCloud, a multilingual text analysis engine, to identify drugs and effects. In addition, we developed the first Spanish database storing drugs as well as their effects automatically built from drug package inserts gathered from online websites. We then applied a distant-supervision method using the database on a collection of 84,000 messages in order to extract the relations between drugs and their effects. To classify the relation instances, we used a kernel method based only on shallow linguistic information of the sentences. Results: Regarding Relation Extraction of drugs and their effects, the distant supervision approach achieved a recall of 0.59 and a precision of 0.48. Conclusions: The task of extracting relations between drugs and their effects from social media is a complex challenge due to the characteristics of social media texts. These texts, typically posts or tweets, usually contain many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Moreover, patients use lay terminology to refer to diseases, symptoms and indications that is not usually included in lexical resources in languages other than English. © 2015 Segura-Bedmar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","26100267",2-s2.0-84977543021

This information can be utilized for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance, via the use of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. However, the language in social media is highly informal, and userexpressed medical concepts are often nontechnical, descriptive, and challenging to extract. There has been limited progress in addressing these challenges, and thus far, advanced machine learning-based NLP techniques have been underutilized. Our objective is to design a machine learning-based approach to extract mentions of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from highly informal text in social media. Methods: We introduce ADRMine, a machine learning-based concept extraction system that uses conditional random fields (CRFs). ADRMine utilizes a variety of features, including a novel feature for modeling words' semantic similarities. The similarities are modeled by clustering words based on unsupervised, pretrained word representation vectors (embeddings) generated from unlabeled user posts in social media using a deep learning technique. Results: ADRMine outperforms several strong baseline systems in the ADR extraction task by achieving an F-measure of 0.82. Feature analysis demonstrates that the proposed word cluster features significantly improve extraction performance. Conclusion: It is possible to extract complex medical concepts, with relatively high performance, from informal, usergenerated content. Our approach is particularly scalable, suitable for social media mining, as it relies on large volumes of unlabeled data, thus diminishing the need for large, annotated training data sets. © The Author 2015.","25755127",2-s2.0-84927943705

Current research focuses on various sources of text-based information, including social media-where enormous amounts of user posted data is available, which have the potential for use in pharmacovigilance if collected and filtered accurately. The aims of this study are: (i) to explore natural language processing (NLP) approaches for generating useful features from text, and utilizing them in optimized machine learning algorithms for automatic classification of ADR assertive text segments; (ii) to present two data sets that we prepared for the task of ADR detection from user posted internet data; and (iii) to investigate if combining training data from distinct corpora can improve automatic classification accuracies. Methods: One of our three data sets contains annotated sentences from clinical reports, and the two other data sets, built in-house, consist of annotated posts from social media. Our text classification approach relies on generating a large set of features, representing semantic properties (. e.g., sentiment, polarity, and topic), from short text nuggets. Importantly, using our expanded feature sets, we combine training data from different corpora in attempts to boost classification accuracies. Results: Our feature-rich classification approach performs significantly better than previously published approaches with ADR class F-scores of 0.812 (previously reported best: 0.770), 0.538 and 0.678 for the three data sets. Combining training data from multiple compatible corpora further improves the ADR F-scores for the in-house data sets to 0.597 (improvement of 5.9 units) and 0.704 (improvement of 2.6 units) respectively. Conclusions: Our research results indicate that using advanced NLP techniques for generating information rich features from text can significantly improve classification accuracies over existing benchmarks. Our experiments illustrate the benefits of incorporating various semantic features such as topics, concepts, sentiments, and polarities. Finally, we show that integration of information from compatible corpora can significantly improve classification performance.

Although the current process of pharmacovigilance is very systematic, the increasing amount of information available in specialized health-related websites as well as the exponential growth in medical literature presents a unique opportunity to supplement traditional adverse event gathering mechanisms with new-age ones. Method. We present a semi-automated pipeline to extract associations between drugs and side effects from traditional structured adverse event databases, enhanced by potential drug-adverse event pairs mined from user-comments from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. The pipeline was tested using a set of 12 drugs representative of two previous studies of adverse event extraction from health-related websites and MEDLINE abstracts. Results: Testing the pipeline shows that mining non-traditional sources helps substantiate the adverse event databases. The non-traditional sources not only contain the known AEs, but also suggest some unreported AEs for drugs which can then be analyzed further. Conclusion: A semi-automated pipeline to extract the AE pairs from adverse event databases as well as potential AE pairs from non-traditional sources such as text from MEDLINE abstracts and user-comments from health-related websites is presented. © 2014 Yeleswarapu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","24559132",2-s2.0-84897634360

To identify these potential drug safety issues early, surveillance must be conducted for each drug throughout its life cycle, from drug development to different phases of clinical trials, and continued after market approval. A major aim of pharmacovigilance is to identify the potential drug-event associations that may be novel in nature, severity, and/or frequency. Currently, the state-of-the-art approach for signal detection is through automated procedures by analyzing vast quantities of data for clinical knowledge. There exists a variety of resources for the task, and many of them are textual data that require text analytics and natural language processing to derive high-quality information. This chapter focuses on the utilization of text mining techniques in identifying potential safety issues of drugs from textual sources such as biomedical literature, consumer posts in social media, and narrative electronic medical records. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","24788270",2-s2.0-84927559916

These events at the post-marketing phase require a significant increase in health care since they result in unnecessary damage, often fatal, to patients. Therefore, the early discovery of adverse events in the post-marketing phase is a primary goal of the health system, in particular for pharmacovigilance systems. The main purpose of this paper is to prove that Twitter can be used as a source to find new and already known adverse drug events. This proposal has a prominent social relevance, as it will help pharmacovigilance systems. Copyright © 2014 SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications All rights reserved.",,2-s2.0-84909957437

In the meantime, increasing numbers of patients have turned to social media to share their experiences with drugs, medical devices, and vaccines. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of concordance between Twitter posts mentioning AE-like reactions and spontaneous reports received by a regulatory agency. Methods: We collected public English-language Twitter posts mentioning 23 medical products from 1 November 2012 through 31 May 2013. Data were filtered using a semi-automated process to identify posts with resemblance to AEs (Proto-AEs). A dictionary was developed to translate Internet vernacular to a standardized regulatory ontology for analysis (MedDRA®). Aggregated frequency of identified product-event pairs was then compared with data from the public FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) by System Organ Class (SOC). Of the 6.9 million Twitter posts collected, 4,401 Proto-AEs were identified out of 60,000 examined. Automated, dictionary-based symptom classification had 72 % recall and 86 % precision. Similar overall distribution profiles were observed, with Spearman rank correlation rho of 0.75 (p < 0.0001) between Proto-AEs reported in Twitter and FAERS by SOC. Conclusion: Patients reporting AEs on Twitter showed a range of sophistication when describing their experience. Despite the public availability of these data, their appropriate role in pharmacovigilance has not been established. Additional work is needed to improve data acquisition and automation. © 2014 The Author(s).","24777653",2-s2.0-84901857191

For surveillance of adverse drug events, patients have gradually become involved in reporting their experiences with medications through the use of dedicated and structured systems. The emerging of social networking provides a way for patients to describe their drug experiences online in less-structured free text format. We developed a computational approach that collects, processes and analyzes Twitter data for drug effects. Our approach uses a machine-learning- based classifier to classify personal experience tweets, and use NLM's MetaMap software to recognize and extract word phrases that belong to drug effects. Our results on 5 medications demonstrate the validity of our approach, and its ability to correctly extract potential drug effects from the Twitter data. It is conceivable that social media data can serve to complement and/or supplement traditional time-consuming and costly surveillance methods. © Springer-Verlag 2013.",,2-s2.0-84893075973

Early detection of adverse events benefits not only the drug regulators, but also the manufacturers for pharmacovigilance. Existing methods rely on patients' ""spontaneous"" self-reports that attest problems. The increasing popularity of social media platforms like the Twitter presents us a new information source for finding potential adverse events. Given the high frequency of user updates, mining Twitter messages can lead us to real-time pharmacovigilance. In this paper, we describe an approach to find drug users and potential adverse events by analyzing the content of twitter messages utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and to build Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Due to the size nature of the dataset (i.e., 2 billion Tweets), the experiments were conducted on a High Performance Computing (HPC) platform using MapReduce, which exhibits the trend of big data analytics. The results suggest that daily-life social networking data could help early detection of important patient safety issues. Copyright © 2012 ACM.",,2-s2.0-84870431352

The system applied association rule mining on a set of annotated comments to extract the underlying patterns of colloquial expressions about adverse effects. The patterns were tested on a set of unseen comments to evaluate their performance. We reached to precision of 70.01% and recall of 66.32% and F-measure of 67.96%.","22195162",2-s2.0-84874210162
